### Tutorial for pdfparser
This is a tutorial in an IPython Notebook for extracting and transfrom text data from PDF files using pdfparser, which I created based on **tika** and **pytesseract**.

### pdfparser
The module pdfparser was created to parse annual reports initially, but it can also be used to extract text data from other pdf files as well with some simple modifications. 

### Dependencies:
The core module pdfparser requires the following libraries:
* tika (Java 7+ is required for this library)
* pytesseract (tesseract is required for this library)
* beatifulsoup
* pdf2image
* opencv
* pandas
* numpy
