Understanding Barclays
BUSINESS PROFILE

Barclays is a British universal bank. We are diversified by business, 
by different types of customer and client, and by geography. 
Our businesses include consumer banking and payments 
operations around the world, as well as a top-tier, full service, 
global corporate and investment bank.

Our structure
Barclays operates as two divisions, Barclays UK  
and Barclays International, supported by our service  
company, Barclays Execution Services – or BX as we call it.

Barclays UK is our UK ring-fenced bank, comprised largely of our UK Personal & Business Banking and Barclaycard Consumer UK businesses. Barclays International consists 
of the Corporate and Investment Bank (CIB) and international Consumer, Cards & Payments (CC&P) businesses. Barclays Execution Services (BX) is the Group-wide service company 
providing technology, operations and functional services to businesses across the Group. 
In March 2019, Barclays announced certain leadership changes, including the appointment of a new Group Head of Consumer Banking & Payments, whose role is to oversee the 
execution of plans for the Group's consumer banking and cards and payments businesses in the UK and internationally.

04 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2019 home.barclays/annualreport

Barclays is one of the major banks of the 
world. It has a long history, sufficient scale 
and significant potential. The last 10 years 
have, however, been fairly troubled in the 
world of finance, including for Barclays. Much 
of this has been self-inflicted but the external 
environment has also been challenging, and 
indeed remains so. It is a tribute to the current 
management team, supported by tens of 
thousands of hard-working and dedicated 
colleagues, and by the Board, that Barclays 
is now in a much stronger position than a 
few years ago to face the challenges ahead. 
I would like to start by thanking them for all 
of their hard work and also to compliment 
my predecessor, John McFarlane, who played 
a key role in overseeing the transition from the 
troubles of the past towards what we believe 
will be a more prosperous and safer future. 
The Board and I will do our best to continue 
that work.

Barclays now has a real purpose, a clear 
strategy, strong values, and improving 
performance. 

Purpose 
Our purpose is expressed in the phrase 
‘creating opportunities to rise'. We want 
to use finance and our broader financing, 
savings and advisory capabilities to help 
customers and clients in our chosen markets; 
to empower our colleagues to play meaningful 
roles in meeting those objectives; and to make 
a real contribution to society in the round.

Over time, these ambitions will enable us to 
build a stronger, better and more valuable 
company for our shareholders. It may be 
unfashionable to talk about banks doing good, 
but something which has struck me as much 
as anything else since arriving at Barclays has 
been the extraordinary breadth and depth of 
activity undertaken by colleagues to help the 
communities in which we work. I also cannot 
but commend the ‘tone from the top'. There 
is a real commitment to make finance simpler 
and more accessible for the vulnerable in 
society. In 2019, we helped 2.3 million 
individuals improve their skills through our 
LifeSkills programme and we helped place 
66,000 individuals into work through our 
Connect with Work partnerships. More 
than in the past, the bank is embracing its 

environmental responsibilities and seeking 
to be one of the leaders in the transition to 
a low-carbon economy. I, and my colleagues, 
are committed to helping Barclays be a force 
for good in society; the pursuit of that goal is 
one of the reasons why I was so enthusiastic 
about assuming this new role.

Strategy
Our results indicate that our strategy is 
working. It is of course, to a degree, shaped by 
our history and by the choices available to us, 
but we can, and constantly think about how 
to, refine it. It is important to focus on where 
we can be strong and effective, but also 
different. We are a British universal bank, 
serving retail and wholesale customers in 
many markets. There are plenty of revenue 
and cost sharing opportunities available 
across our retail, corporate and investment 
banking platforms and activities. Recent 
results, with an improving Corporate and 
Investment Bank and the UK retail market 
under pressure, demonstrate that we benefit 
from this diversification. Furthermore, we are 
a committed Europe headquartered universal 
bank and a leading European player in the US. 
In today's world that has real benefit.

Performance
That is not to say of course, that we have 
yet got everything right. Performance over 
the last few years has seen a step change in 
its trajectory, consistency and transparency 
to all of our stakeholders. The Group has 
transformed. Underlying returns and cost 
efficiency have improved and the capital 
position is now secure. Group return on 
tangible equity has improved year on year 
to 9.0%, in line with the 2019 target, yet our 
target is to perform consistently above 10%. 
The global macroeconomic environment and 
current low interest rates mean it has become 
more challenging to achieve this and the 
Board and the management team recognise 
that there is still work to do. The 
underperforming areas have been clearly 
identified and are, we believe, receiving the 
appropriate strategic attention and indeed 
investment where that makes sense. 

Building a stronger, better  
and more valuable company

CHAIRMAN'S INTRODUCTION

Barclays has a real purpose, a clear strategy, 
strong values and improving performance.

Nigel Higgins
Chairman

Barclays is now 
in a much stronger 
position than a few 
years ago to face 
the challenges ahead.

This is not a short journey. Business is never 
easy but we, like many of our peers, have 
the real challenge of ensuring that all our 
businesses, whether addressing family 
finance, derivatives trading or SME lending 
to name but a few, stand up with the best in 
a digital world. This has to be achieved while 
the ‘factory' keeps operating, with minimal 
customer inconvenience and within the 
parameters for investment returns which 
we and our shareholders deem appropriate. 
Over the last three or four years, the current 
management team has strengthened the 
control environment of the bank and dealt 
with our major legacy conduct issues. At the 
same time we are ensuring the operational 
resilience of the organisation, including our 
ability to deal with cyberthreats, which have 
unfortunately become part of daily life. We 
are not satisfied however that we are yet at 
‘best-in-class' status across the board. Nor 
have we reduced customer complaints, in 
particular in the retail business, as far as we 
think should be possible. All this remains to 
be done.

In assessing our performance, including 
how far we have gone in hitting not just our 
financial targets but our ambitions around 
resilience and customer satisfaction, we look 
at multiple measures. In the rest of this report 
you will find a balanced assessment of where 
we stand in our major business areas when 
it comes to business performance, colleague 
engagement and customer or client 
satisfaction and feedback. We also stand 
back and look at our contribution to society, 
including what more we can do. 

That includes how we are thinking about the 
environment and tackling climate change. 
We are committed to a positive, thoughtful 
and authentic role in the transition to a 
low-carbon economy and are, and will 
continue to be, working closely with all of 
our stakeholders to ensure that we make 
a real difference.

Culture 
I would like to add a word about the culture of 
the organisation. At an individual level I have 
been very impressed with the way in which 
colleagues clearly live our values. This is 
equally true in places as diverse as London, 
New York, Whippany, Northampton, Glasgow, 
Manchester, Pune and Chennai. Concern for 
the individual is broad at Barclays and we 
strive to lead the way in providing 
opportunities for colleagues with disabilities 
and in supporting those with mental health 
issues. Finding ways to help talent progress, 
inside and outside the firm, and respecting 
the diversity of all of our communities are 
again deep rooted characteristics of the 
organisation. There is also a deep sense of 
loyalty to Barclays, whether in the UK retail 
business, in the more international Corporate 
and Investment Bank or in Consumer, Cards 
and Payments, which today houses much of 
the old Barclaycard business. In BX, the service 
centre for the worldwide Group, there is a real 
fixation with professional excellence and 
teamwork. The firm overall, however, remains 
quite complex and occasionally still operates 
in silos, too slowly or with too many layers.

This is another management challenge for 
the future: how to take all of our culture and 
processes into the 21st-century, moving the 
organisation completely from product focus 
to customer or client focus, and embracing 
the fact that the acceptable speed of delivery 
is today often measured in seconds or 
minutes rather than weeks.

The Board 
The process of simplification has started 
with the Board. The Board is a little bit smaller 
than it was; we are grateful for the dedicated 
service of those who left in 2019. We are 
delighted to have added Dawn Fitzpatrick, 
Mohamed El-Erian and Brian Gilvary to 
the Board, all of whom bring considerable 
experience in our end markets. We have also 
simplified the structure at the top of the 
organisation, increasing the overlap between 
members of the Board of Barclays PLC and 
that of Barclays Bank PLC, the company which 
houses our Barclays International businesses 
(Corporate and Investment Bank and 
Consumer, Cards and Payments). For the next 
phase, we aim to add more new faces to the 
Board, increasing relevant domain knowledge 
and bringing a greater diversity of background 
and opinion. We aspire to a Board that 
challenges management in a constructive 
way, knows its subject matter, understands 
its governance responsibilities and adds real 
value to the senior management team. 

The future 
What to expect for the future? We are 
committed to our target of generating returns 
over time of over 10%. The macroeconomic 
environment, with low interest rates and a flat 
yield curve, makes it harder to achieve that 
than we had hoped. Nonetheless, we strive 
to more than cover the cost of capital on a 
sustainable basis. We have started to increase 
cash returns to shareholders and we plan to 
continue in that vein. We will keep costs under 
control and BX will prove an active engine to 
drive cost efficiency and create capacity for 
targeted investments. We will grow certain 
businesses, with a bias towards those which 
are less capital intensive, and continue to 
invest in our differentiated strengths as an 
incredibly strong financing, advisory and 
servicing bank for retail and wholesale 
customers around the world. I believe that 
we are fortunate in having a management 
team which is focused relentlessly on 
delivering the improvements ahead. 

Nigel Higgins
Chairman

We stand back and look 
at our contribution to 
society, including what 
more we can do.

https://home.barclays/investor-relations/reports-and-events/annual-reports/
<Page End><Page Start>
06 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2019 home.barclays/annualreport

I'm very proud of the way the management 
team and our colleagues around the world 
have maintained their focus on making a 
tangible difference every day to the customers 
and clients we are here to serve. In delivering 
for them, we continue to demonstrate that 
the strategic path we are on is the right one 
for our organisation. 

Continuing to deliver
The choices we have made about the shape 
and scale of Barclays are being validated by 
our performance. We know that we have more 
to do, but today we are a well-capitalised, 
British universal bank that is consistently 
profitable.

The diversity of the Group, both 
geographically and by business, remains a 
source of real strength. It provides us with 
exposure to growth in different economies, 
balance across currency fluctuations, and 
resilience through the economic cycle.

BX, our service company, continues to be 
a powerful force in continuously improving 
the efficiency, effectiveness and control of our 
core operating platform. It will also help create 
the capacity to invest in our future as the right 
opportunities present themselves.

These defining features of our business have 
meant our financial performance has again 
improved on the previous year, and the 
momentum in Barclays continues to build. 
We are in a strong capital position, with a 
Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 13.8%. We 
have delivered return on tangible equity of 
9%, in line with our 2019 target, with income 
up 2% and costs down 2%.

Our financial strength has enabled us to 
return capital to shareholders, which we will 
continue to do through a progressive ordinary 
dividend supplemented with additional cash 
returns, including share buy-backs, as and 
when appropriate. But, more than that, it's a 
performance that means we can make choices 
about our future from a position of stability.

Guided by our purpose
As we write the next chapter of Barclays' 
story, those choices are guided by our purpose. 
The profession of banking has a unique role 
in society and it is our fundamental belief 
that we can and must do business in a way 
that does good. Through the work we do 
with our customers and clients, we can have 
a meaningful impact on the progress of our 
communities and the preservation of our 
environment, as well as making a positive 
difference to the health and well-being of 
our employees.

We take that duty seriously, and it shapes 
our view of the professional culture we want 
to be known for and the business we want 
to become.

Looking to  
the future

CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S INTRODUCTION

2019 has seen Barclays emerge from its 
transformation of recent years as a stronger, 
leaner, higher-performing organisation.

James E. Staley
Group Chief Executive

We are today a 
well-capitalised, 
British universal bank 
that is consistently 
profitable.

The challenges ahead
Our future is not entirely within our own 
hands, however, and we must recognise the 
role that factors outside of our control will 
always play in our continued success.

The global economic environment will be 
markedly different in the medium term than 
it has been in recent decades. Despite very 
low levels of unemployment across the 
developed world, persistently low wage 
inflation and a related lack of inflationary 
pressure will likely cause central banks to 
hold interest rates at low levels for longer 
than otherwise expected. This in turn could 
raise concerns that the valuation of financial 
assets will become inflated.

We also see further regulatory change, 
and continued uncertainty related to Brexit, 
creating additional headwinds. 

That is the reality of the context in which we 
will operate next year, but we are confident 
that Barclays is well-positioned and will 
further improve returns meaningfully in 2020.

Growing our business
The profitability and cost efficiency of our 
model mean that we are also sustainably 
creating the capacity to grow. 

We are focused on growth in areas where 
we have a significant customer base and 
believe we can differentiate Barclays over 
the next three to five years. In particular, 
growth in fee-based, technology-led, annuity 
businesses with lower capital intensity will 
further diversify the organisation, without 
limiting our commitment to the businesses 
we already have.

We will accelerate our digital journey, and 
continue to play a leading role in capturing 
innovation and bringing it to life, at scale, 
for millions of customers and clients. 

I am very grateful for the generous support 
and guidance the management team and I 
enjoy from our Chairman and the Board. We 
know that we must stay focused and maintain 
our pace, but we believe that Barclays is well 
placed to continue the momentum we have 
built through our transformation.

We look forward to delivering for all of our 
stakeholders in 2020 and beyond.

James E. Staley
Group Chief Executive

We will continue to 
play a leading role in 
capturing innovation 
and bringing it to life, 
at scale, for millions of 
customers and clients.

Our strategy
PURPOSE AND STRATEGY

We have a proud history and deep roots in 
the UK, with the scale and diversity to serve 
customers and clients around the world 
across a broad range of their financial needs.

Our strategy
As a purpose-driven organisation, 
we aspire to create opportunities 
to rise for all of our stakeholders. 
Our strategy has been developed to 
balance the needs of our customers 
and clients, our colleagues, our 
investors and wider society. 

We have transformed Barclays 
over the last four years, responding 
to changes in the economic and 
regulatory environment, and to the 
changing needs of our customers 
and clients.

There are only a handful of banks 
in the world that can now do what 
we do. We have domestic strength; 
diversification of customers and 
clients, and of products; scale and 
geographic reach; an efficient and 
stable operating model; and a strong 
and positive culture.

We know we need to keep up the pace 
of evolution and delivery, and that we 
have more to do. Our customers and 
clients expect us to play a leading 
role in making banking work better 
tomorrow than today. Regulation 
continues to develop. The economic 
backdrop, particularly low interest 
rates, will present challenges for all 
banks for the foreseeable future.

Our strategy builds on our strengths 
and will steer us through those 
challenges. We must deliver for all of 
our stakeholders by understanding 
and balancing their different 
expectations of our business. 

We will do that via our  
4 strategic pillars.

Creating opportunities to rise

Our aim is to connect the ideas, innovations 
and aspirations of our customers and clients to the 

capital that can bring them to life.

1  
Focusing 

on customers 
and clients

Putting them at the heart 
of decision making about 

how to manage our 
business today, and how 
to shape it for the future.

2  
Becoming 

more digital

Because that's 
increasingly how our 
customers and clients 
prefer to deal with us, 

and because it makes our 
business more efficient.

3  
Protecting and 
strengthening 

our culture

Drawing on our purpose 
and values to guide our 

choices as individuals and 
as an organisation.

4  
Maintaining and 
increasing our 
diversification

Looking for opportunities 
within and outside our 
organisation that build 

on our current strengths and 
make us resilient in different 

economic conditions.

core operating platform in BX, we can often 
make improvements once, but get the benefit 
everywhere.

We're in the distinctive position of enabling 
consumers to make payments digitally, while 
also supporting the companies who receive 
those payments. Because we can see all 
sides of a transaction we have the data about 
how payments work. And we're using our 
investment in technology to give us actionable 
insights into the payment process that make 
life quicker and simpler for our customers 
and clients. For example, we've helped one 
large UK insurance client realise millions of 
pounds' worth of additional online customer 
transactions, simply as a result of the 
improvements we made in their 
payment routes.

We track things like Net Promoter Scores 
(NPS) and what people think of our brand, as 
well as the number of complaints we receive 
when we haven't got things right.

We believe that designing our business 
around what people want is the best way to 
do more business. And when we look for new 
opportunities in the future, we believe that's 
also the best place to start.

There's more to do in reshaping Barclays to 
make the most of the connections between 
our businesses. We'll continue to do that by 
starting with a real customer or client need 
and working back from there.

1.  Focusing on customers 
and clients

We do more business with our customers and 
clients when we make it easy for them to deal 
with us. We believe the best way to do that is 
to listen to what people are trying to achieve, 
and how they would like to achieve it.

Our Barclays UK customers told us, for 
example, that using one app to manage 
their Barclaycard and another to manage 
everything else wasn't as easy as it should be. 
So we changed it, and now they can access 
everything in the same award-winning 
Barclays Appa.

They also told us that buying a new house 
was stressful enough, so they really wanted 
getting a mortgage to be as easy as possible. 
We looked again at the process and made it 
simpler, and introduced a video chat service to 
help guide people through it. As a result, many 
of our customers can now get a mortgage 
approved on the same day.

New clients signing up to our payments 
business told us that it took too long to get on 
board. So we worked to simplify and speed up 
the process, meaning that we now have same 
day on-boarding for most of our customers 
– and with less paperwork too.

We're making small changes right across 
Barclays every day to make things better. And 
because all of our businesses share a common

Our strategy
PURPOSE AND STRATEGY

2. Becoming more digital
The world is becoming more digital. For lots 
of our retail, corporate and institutional 
customers, it's how they prefer to do 
their banking.

So we're investing more than ever in building 
the Barclays of the future. 

In Corporate Banking, we have been building 
a single digital platform, which over 80% of 
our corporate clients are now using. 

In our Markets business, we have been 
investing to stay at the forefront of the 
industry-wide shift to greater electronic 
execution.

In our retail businesses we now have 
significant expertise in delivering digital 
services. 

More of our customers are choosing to 
bank with us online and on their phones. 
In Barclays UK we currently have over 
11 million digitally-active customers and 
nearly 8.5 million active mobile banking users. 

And we're seeing better customer 
engagement as a result.

However, we recognise that more complex 
needs still need to be dealt with in person, 
with technology helping wherever it can. 
So our investment in the future is also going 
towards making our branches more digital, 
which means they're quicker and easier to 
use for everyone. In fact, 91% of our customer 
transactions are now automated across all 
our channels. 

In a digital world, data is what joins everything 
together. Banking has always been about 
making connections and we're using the 
diverse data from across our business to 
make new connections.

We're helping our retail customers to manage 
their household budgets by using data to 
understand where their money's going, 
and bringing them a more personalised 
experience; we're helping merchants improve 
their customer payment and e-commerce 
experience by using data to understand and 
simplify their checkout process. We're helping 
corporate clients use data to manage their 
supply chain better.

Data is a valuable asset and we know that 
people care deeply about their privacy and 
security. We've been protecting both for 
years and we are not going to stop now. 
We continue to invest in our infrastructure 
to ensure it is resilient to cybercrime and 
we have deployed a number of cybercrime 
detection tools to protect customer data. 
We have also released a range of products 
and services to help keep customers safe, 
ranging from algorithm-based fraud detection 
to card freezing capabilities in the mobile 
banking app.

Safe and secure in a digital age 
Building resilience
Our customers have trusted us to 
keep their money safe and secure 
for over 325 years. As banking has 
become more digital, so have the 
threats, which means that protecting 
our customers, and ourselves, has 
become more digital too.

Criminals are more sophisticated 
today than ever before, but we've 
invested millions in security, 
resilience and defence to hold 
them back.

We've built state-of-the-art joint 
operations centres around the world, 
so that we're watching for the next 
attack 24 hours a day, 365 days a 
year. We've introduced machine 
learning to help spot and stop 
fraudulent transactions. 

We're using in-app and online 
prompts, as well as our adverts, 
to help educate customers about 
new types of fraud and scams, such 
as push payment fraud. And we're 
protecting the privacy of our 
customers with world-class data 
protection.

As technology continues to change, 
we know that the threats will keep 
evolving too. But our plans to make 
our bank more digital mean we're 
committed to always staying one 
step ahead.

We are focused on making our business 
more resilient, better controlled, and more 
efficient. Being more digital also allows us to 
significantly reduce our costs, which creates 
the financial capacity to invest in growth.

We have centralised the core operating 
functions of Barclays into BX, the digital heart 
of our organisation. Over the past two years 
that's enabled us to reduce duplication, 
simplify our operating environment and 
re-engineer our processes.

As we become more digital, we want to play 
a leading role in capturing innovation and 
bringing it to life – at scale. 

We'll do that through partnerships with 
entrepreneurs building the future from 
the ground up, through our global Rise 
community of FinTech innovators, and our 
Eagle Labs community in the UK. And we'll 
do it by working closely with innovators 
inside and outside our organisation, through 
Barclays Ventures and innovation-focused 
teams across Barclays, to accelerate the 
growth of new business lines and build new 
customer propositions around disruptive 
technology.

3.  Protecting and 
strengthening our culture

As a purpose-driven organisation, we are 
working hard to create a culture where each 
and every colleague feels empowered to take 
decisions that balance all our stakeholder 
interests.

Our most senior leaders spend significant time 
setting the right tone at Barclays, and our 
purpose and values are now deeply embedded 
in their message. 

We are committed to creating a culture which 
gives our colleagues the opportunity to reach 
their potential, within an inclusive and 
supportive environment.

As an example of this, we have launched the 
BeWell programme which provides expert 
advice and guidance on practical steps that 
colleagues can take to look after their physical 
and mental health. 

You can read more about our approach 
to supporting our people on pages 28 
to 31.

We believe that our purpose-driven culture will 
help us reduce the impact of poor conduct on 
our stakeholders and our financial performance 
and we track our progress through metrics 
such as the number of operational risk events 
and compliance breaches.

Outside our organisation, we believe that our 
success over the long term is tied inextricably 
to the positive impact we can have on the 
environment and the communities where we 
live and work.

You can read more about how we see 
our role in society on pages 32 to 35.

4.  Maintaining and increasing 
our diversification 

Our diversification is a real strength, and we 
will maintain and increase our diversity as 
we evolve. 

Our revenue today comes from different 
businesses, different types of customer and 
client, different types of income, and different 
geographies. We believe this diversification 
creates the balance and resilience required to 
deliver through the economic cycle. 

As a result of having such a broad range of 
products and services, we can support our 
customers and clients across almost all of 
their financial needs. It also creates 
opportunities for growth. 

Across our businesses there are multiple areas 
where we benefit from significant scale – and 
where there is opportunity to further enhance 
the products and services we deliver for our 
customers and clients, without materially 
increasing capital deployed. 

For example, in our payments business, we are 
using our strengths in the UK to better serve 
UK small businesses, while also targeting 
international expansion in Europe. Our 
Corporate Bank is enhancing its client-facing 
digital platform and expanding into new 
European markets without the overheads of a 
branch presence. And Barclays UK is building 
an integrated banking, financial planning and 
investments platform connected to the 
Barclays App, and focusing on our c.1m 
Premier customers. 

In addition, by combining our operating 
platform, through BX, we can share our 
investment and expertise across the whole 
of Barclays. 

Our results indicate that our strategy is 
delivering. By optimising returns in our scale 
businesses whilst targeting growth in some 
of our less capital intensive businesses, 
we believe that we will continue to deliver. 
Our business model, described on the 
following pages, is the way in which we use 
our resources and deploy our strengths to 
deliver value for all our stakeholders.

Barclays aims to create value for its stakeholders, balanced across 
both the short and the long term. We engage with our stakeholders 
to better inform them of our activities and to create mutually 
supportive opportunities and outcomes for them.

Engaging with our stakeholders
STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

Who are our stakeholders?
Why we focus on 
these stakeholders? How do we engage them? What do they tell us? How do we respond to them?

CUSTOMERS AND CLIENTS

Our customers and clients are those 
stakeholders who use our products, 
services and financial expertise.

Our customers and clients are 
central to our business – without 
them, we would not exist.

We engage and build our relationships with 
our customers and clients in a number of 
ways, from face-to-face interactions to the 
award-winning Barclays App.

We conduct a wide range of customer and 
client research to better understand their 
interactions with, and expectations of, Barclays. 
This includes close analysis of our NPS and 
monitoring of customer complaints.

Based on data from millions of individual transactions 
and personal interactions, our customers and clients 
tell us they want:

■■ to be able to trust that our products and services 
meet their needs

■■ value for money
■■ to find Barclays easy to deal with.

These insights help to inform our business decisions 
and improve our products and services.

In 2019, we developed our services following engagement with our customers 
and clients. These included:

■■ holding events for customers and clients ranging from our Eagle Labs to over 
200 local clinics for UK SMEs to prepare for Brexit

■■ the upgrade of BARX as an integrated, cross-asset electronic trading platform 
to create a better experience for Investment Bank clients

■■ raising the unsecured lending limit to £100k for SME clients with a digital 
application process allowing clients to receive money within 24 hours.

See pages 20 to 27

COLLEAGUES 

Our colleagues embody our culture 
and provide excellent service to our 
customers and clients.

Our people are our most valuable 
asset. They make a critical 
difference to our success, and our 
investment in them protects and 
strengthens our culture. 

We have an established approach to engaging 
colleagues to ensure we take their perspectives 
into account in our decision-making and 
action plans, and share with them our strategy 
and progress. Our employee opinion survey 
formally captures their views and is a key part 
of how we track engagement. 

Our leaders engage face to face with 
colleagues locally and we engage collectively, 
including through an effective partnership with 
Unite, and the Barclays Group European Forum. 

In the 2019 employee opinion survey, our colleagues 
told us: 

■■ overall colleague engagement score is 77%
■■ 88% say they are able to work dynamically, and 80% 

would recommend Barclays as a good place to work 
■■ only 61% said the stress levels at work are manageable 

and only 53% believe that we have been successful in 
eliminating obstacles to efficiency. 

This data and other insights form an important part  
of our decision-making, and improving these scores 
is a key priority.

The results from our employee opinion survey help shape how we run the 
business and the areas that will make a real difference to our colleagues:

■■ we ensure everyone is kept up to date on the strategy, performance and 
progress of Barclays through a co-ordinated, multi-channel approach 
across a combination of leader-led engagement, and digital and print 
communication

■■ we are continuing to focus on tools and training for physical and mental  
well-being and we are investing in technology and in our premises.

See pages 28 to 31

SOCIETY

Society is represented by the 
communities in which we serve as 
well as the world in which we live.

Delivering long-term returns for 
all our stakeholders depends on 
deep and thoughtful engagement 
with the numerous individuals 
and interest groups representing 
wider society.

We engage in a continual dialogue with 
non-governmental organisations (NGOs) 
and other interest groups to improve our 
understanding of current and emerging 
environmental and societal topics. 

We participate in multiple sustainability and 
human rights forums and global and regional 
industry initiatives, engaging directly through 
Barclays' Sustainability and Environmental, 
Social and Governance (ESG) teams.

During 2019, our society stakeholders told us that they 
wanted to hear more about:

■■ supporting our customers and clients in the transition 
to a low-carbon economy

■■ responsible financing for companies in sensitive 
energy sectors

■■ managing our broader environmental and social 
impacts

■■ the support we're giving to the communities in which 
we operate.

We responded on key topics in 2019 through a wide range of 
initiatives including: 

■■ publication of our Energy & Climate Change and Forestry and  
Palm Oil Statements

■■ becoming a founding signatory of the United Nations Principles 
for Responsible Banking 

■■ continued growth in our suite of green finance products 
■■ maintaining ongoing dialogue with a wide range of NGOs 
■■ further engagement on ESG with investors and broader stakeholders
■■ launching Building Thriving Local Economies pilots in the UK.See pages 32 to 35

INVESTORS 

Our investor stakeholder group 
encompasses all parties interested 
in the success and sustainability 
of the business, from our shareholders 
and bondholders to regulators 
and public policy makers.

Delivering for our investors 
ensures the business continues 
to be successful in the long term 
and can therefore continue to 
deliver for all our stakeholders. 

We conduct extensive engagement with our 
institutional equity and fixed income investors 
throughout the year.

We have a collaborative and transparent 
dialogue with our regulators and work together 
to ensure we meet prudential and conduct 
based regulatory standards, contributing to 
a safe and robust banking system. 

Our AGMs give the Board the opportunity to 
engage with investors on the running of their 
company, and to receive feedback.

Discussions with our investors included:

■■ drivers of sustainable improvement in Group returns 
■■ the macroeconomic environment and headwinds 

to the delivery of our strategy and targets
■■ our focus on cost efficiency and ongoing investment 

in digital and technology

We continued to have constructive engagement with 
regulators, evidenced by positive stress test outcomes. 

ESG engagement increased during 2019, reflecting the pace 
of change in the industry and its importance to our investors.

We have responded to investors in a number of ways including:

■■ the new Chairman's ‘listening tour', which helped to inform new deep-dive 
Board sessions

■■ passing the 2019 BoE and CCAR stress tests, giving regulators in the UK and 
US comfort in our capital position

■■ taking Barclays to its stakeholders, from 2020, the AGM will be held outside 
of London; our 2020 AGM will be held in Glasgow, where we are building a 
new strategic campus site.

Section 172(1) statement
The Directors have acted in a way that they 
considered, in good faith, to be most likely 
to promote the success of the Company for 
the benefit of its members as a whole, and 
in doing so had regard, amongst other 
matters, to:

■■ the likely consequences of any decision 
in the long term

■■ the interests of the Company's employees
■■ the need to foster the Company's business 

relationships with suppliers, customers 
and others

■■ the impact of the Company's operations 
on the community and the environment

■■ the desirability of the Company 
maintaining a reputation for high 
standards of business conduct

■■ the need to act fairly as between 
members of the Company.

The Directors also took into account the views 
and interests of a wider set of stakeholders, 
including our pensioners, regulators, the 
Government and non-governmental 
organisations. You can find out more about 
how Barclays engages with its stakeholders 
on the previous pages.

Considering this broad range of interests 
is an important part of the way the Board 
makes decisions, although in balancing 
those different perspectives it won't always 
be possible to deliver everyone's desired 
outcome.

How does the Board engage 
with stakeholders?
The Board will sometimes engage directly 
with certain stakeholders on certain issues, 
but the size and distribution of our 
stakeholders and of Barclays means that 
stakeholder engagement often takes place 
at an operational level.

The Board considers and discusses 
information from across the organisation 
to help it understand the impact of Barclays 
operations, and the interests and views of 
our key stakeholders. It also reviews strategy, 
financial and operational performance, as 
well as information covering areas such as 
key risks, and legal and regulatory compliance. 
This information is provided to the Board 
through reports sent in advance of each Board 
meeting, and through in-person presentations.

As a result of these activities, the Board has 
an overview of engagement with stakeholders, 
and other relevant factors, which enables the 
Directors to comply with their legal duty 
under section 172 of the Companies Act 2006.

For more details on how our Board operates, 
and the way in which it reaches decisions, 
including the matters it discussed and 
debated during the year, please see  
pages 48 to 51.

Engagement in action
The following are some examples of how 
the Directors have had regard to the matters 
set out in sections 172(1)(a)-(f ) when 
discharging their section 172 duties and the 
effect of that on certain of the decisions taken 
by them. 

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

Being accountable  
for our decisions
Our governance is designed to ensure that 
we take into account the views of all our 
stakeholders, so that our decision-making is 
collaborative and well-informed – both before 
and after we make our decisions public. 

In October 2019, we announced that we 
would be withdrawing over-the-counter 
access to cash for our customers at Post 
Offices in the UK. This was a decision made 
after carefully balancing the economic impact 
of a significant increase in transaction fees, 
and our ability to put in place comprehensive 
plans to safeguard our customers' access 
to cash. Following our announcement, 
we continued to engage with customers, 
Members of Parliament, and the government. 
It became clear from this further engagement 
that our full participation in the Post Office 
Banking Framework is crucial to the viability 
of the Post Office network at this point in time. 

As a result of that further engagement and 
debate, we reversed our decision. The Board 
has reviewed the planning and decision-
making process around this issue. This has 
highlighted and reconfirmed, among other 
things, the importance of listening to all of 
our stakeholders, on an ongoing basis.

 Improving the quality 
of our decision-making
The Board's agenda in 2019 has been 
significantly influenced by a comprehensive 
‘listening tour' undertaken by our new 
Chairman following his arrival at Barclays in 
March, before he became Chairman in May. 
Nigel Higgins held around 50 meetings with 
shareholders and other stakeholders as part of 
this ‘listening tour' and has also subsequently 
spent considerable time this year meeting 
with stakeholders across the globe as part of 
his induction, including with our investors, 
customers and colleagues. 

The Board and Executive Committee used the 
feedback to agree a prioritised series of deep 
dives which now form a significant part of 
each Board meeting. These deep dives have 
helped to facilitate an in-depth understanding 
of issues with a view to helping management 
and the Board make well-informed decisions 
both now and in the future. The deep dives 
conducted in 2019 covered a wide range of 
topics, including focus on particular business 
areas, capital allocation, our culture, our 
societal purpose and environmental matters. 

 Striving for simplicity  
and effectiveness
Barclays is a large, diversified organisation 
and in 2019 the Board took several decisions 
to simplify its governance model. The 
consolidation and streamlining of 
membership of the Barclays PLC and Barclays 
Bank PLC Boards, announced in September 
2019, has benefited Board members and 
our colleagues by significantly increasing 
co-ordination and efficiency and reducing 
complexity and duplication. 

Oversight of the activities of Barclays Bank 
PLC, which includes our CIB, is now vested 
in a board the members of which also have 
direct accountability to Barclays PLC's 
shareholders through their separate 
responsibilities as members of the Barclays 
PLC Board. In reaching this decision, the Board 
took great care to consider the broader UK 
regulatory environment, so as to safeguard 
both the letter and the spirit of the UK 
ring-fencing legislation which came into force 
at the start of 2019. 

Recognising the importance of our culture, 
reputation and the environment to the Board 
and to all our stakeholders, we also decided 
to transfer primary oversight for these key 
matters from the Reputation Committee to 
the Board.

Deep dives have 
helped the Board to 
develop an in-depth 
understanding of 
issues such as capital 
allocation, culture, 
and societal purpose.

18 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2019 home.barclays/annualreport

A broad range of financial and non-financial 
measures are analysed as part of regular 
business strategy and performance reviews. 

To assess our performance, we use a number 
of sources including regular management 
reporting of our key metrics, as well as 
external measures, to provide a balanced 
review of performance during the year, while 
additionally monitoring for emerging trends.

Performance against our financial targets and 
strategic non-financial performance measures 
is directly linked to executive remuneration, 
and influences incentive outcomes for Barclays' 
employees more broadly. This approach 
enables us to deliver positive and sustainable 
outcomes for all our stakeholders while 
maintaining flexibility for our businesses 
to adapt in a fast-moving world. 

We consider a range of metrics across all 
stakeholder groups and continuously assess 
whether new measures should be added or 
removed from our dashboards, in order to 
ensure these remain relevant and appropriate. 
For example, in recent years, digital 
engagement and related customer satisfaction 
scores have become increasingly important 
as we continue on our digital journey. 

Key measures used in our 2019 assessment 
include, but are not limited to, the metrics 
reported on this page, and in the broader 
discussion of our performance on the 
following Customers and Clients, 
Colleagues and Society pages.

Barclays is one of the most recognisable 
British brands. We serve customers in the 
UK across the entire spectrum of their 
banking needs.

We also support small and medium-sized 
businesses, providing the financing, saving 
and transactional products and services they 
need to grow. 

Strategic priorities

Barclays UK places customers at the centre 
of what we do. This means listening to our 
customers, and adapting our products and 
services to ensure we have the capabilities 
to support their ever-evolving needs – from 
receiving their first salary payment, through 
moving home to saving and investing for 
retirement. It also means transforming the 
way we organise ourselves by creating a core 
team centred around our customers' needs, 
enabling us to move faster.

As part of our transformation, we are using 
technology to improve our service and to 
make it more efficient and reliable for our 
customers. We continue to make progress 
in eliminating the causes of complaints 
and improving the quality of our service. 
Nevertheless, accelerating progress on behalf 
of our customers remains a key priority, as the 
interruptions to our services and the level of 
complaints we receive from our customers is 
still more than we would like.

The way we serve our customers is 
increasingly digital, a reflection of how 
most of our customers now prefer to interact 
with us. Further investment in our digital 
capabilities remains fundamental to our 
strategy, ensuring that our customers have 
the flexibility to manage the majority of their 
day-to-day banking needs via mobile and 
online banking.

This allows us to understand our customers' 
needs to a degree never previously possible, 
meaning we can tailor our services 
accordingly and deliver insights to customers, 
which help them manage their finances more 
effectively.

Additionally, the investment we are making 
in our technology, especially moving to the 
Cloud, means that we can get products to 
customers more quickly and deliver a more 
personalised digital experience.

However, we recognise that more complex 
needs, like property transactions, still need 
to be dealt with in person. That's why we're 
also investing in our physical locations, using 
technology wherever possible, to make them 
quicker and easier to use for everyone. 

Operating environment

The lower interest rate environment makes 
borrowing more affordable but, combined with 
intense competition in the mortgage market 
and our focus on secured lending, continues 
to compress our net interest margin.

The accelerated pace of change in this 
competitive environment has also moved 
the traditional boundaries of retail banking 
and reshaped customer expectations. We 
are making good progress in meeting these 
new expectations, for example, with balance 
tracking, spending categorisation and a 
controls hub allowing customers to manage 
the types of spend they want, but we 
recognise that we still have more to do.

We must also continue to adapt to evolving 
regulation, for example by offering 
alternatives to traditional forms of credit 
in unsecured lending. 

Our achievements 
in 2019

We continued to progress our digital strategy 
through 2019. As at the end of the year, 
59% of our products were provided to our 
customers through digital channels and 
the number of digitally-active customers 
increased by 6% to 11.4 million year on year.

We upgraded our mobile banking offering so 
that our customers can now use one app to 
access their Barclaycard account alongside 
other Barclays products. This upgrade also 
meant that 1.2 million Barclaycard customers, 
who previously had no relationship with us 
other than their credit card, can now access 
more of our products and services through 
the Barclays App.

We have also improved the products and 
services that we offer our customers. 
2019 saw us enhance our market-leading 
unsecured business loans, enabling Business 
Banking clients to borrow up to £100,000 
digitally – an increase from £25,000 
previously. This is another industry first for 
Barclays, as we are currently the only UK bank 
able to offer an instant answer on clients' 
eligibility for lending at this scale, and making 
funds available the next working day.

Barclays UK
CUSTOMERS AND CLIENTS

We have progressed with efforts to improve 
our digital estate, data capabilities and 
ultimately create the opportunity to better 
engage partners. We have continued our 
support for some of the most promising 
emerging FinTechs through our network 
of Rise sites and deepened our strategic 
relationship with MarketFinance (a peer-
to-peer invoice discounting platform).

Overall, our relentless focus on customers 
is reflected in an improved Net Promoter 
Score for Barclays UK of +18, and +11 for the 
Barclaycard brand, which shows the strength 
and depth of our relationships.

Focus for 2020 
and beyond

We aim to continue the progress made 
during 2019 in driving down complaints, by 
continuing to identify and address the root 
cause of customer problems, and by making 
selective investments to improve 
infrastructure.

We want to continue to improve our 
customers' digital experience in 2020, as well 
as developing enhancements to our online 
and mobile platforms. We will continue to 
invest in equipping our people with the tools 
and skills they need to achieve this, as well as 
strengthening our culture.

We are also creating an integrated banking, 
advice and investments platform, building on 
our award-winninga Barclays App. Customers 
will be able to access financial planning 
services and investment products, as an 
extension of their existing banking products 
and services.

Finally, we will continue to embed our new 
ways of working into our organisation, in 
order to ensure that we are able to meet 
our customers' ever-evolving needs.

Fostering innovation 
Barclays Eagle Labs
Barclays Eagle Labs is a platform 
to support the UK's entrepreneurial 
community. Through a national network 
of 24 labs we incubate high-growth tech 
businesses, offering co-working spaces, 
mentoring opportunities and access 
to cutting-edge technology to rapidly 
prototype new product ideas. 

We currently support over 
470 startups and to date our 
members and alumni have 
collectively raised over £600m 
of funding. 

Committed to connecting communities, 
in 2019 we hosted or helped organise 
2,200 events throughout the UK. These 
were attended by over 80,000 people, 
with a strong focus on educating 
individuals, businesses and larger 
organisations.

CUSTOMERS AND CLIENTS

Our Corporate and Investment Bank is one 
of the world's leading providers of funding, 
financing, cash management, advisory and 
risk management products and services. 
We work with money managers, financial 
institutions, governments and corporate 
clients globally to help them innovate 
and grow. 

Strategic priorities

Over the last few years, our US competitors 
have consolidated their strong position, and 
our European peers have focused efforts on 
a narrower product set. 

Barclays is therefore able to differentiate 
itself as a European headquartered provider 
of universal banking services. As our clients 
look to diversify their service providers, and 
decrease their exposure to the US credit cycle, 
we believe our ability to provide this 
diversification is a real strength. 

Our strategy is also shaped by the increasingly 
sophisticated needs of our clients, and 
technological evolution across our industry.

We are focused on three areas:

Adapting to the evolving needs of our clients

We are investing in technology that makes it 
easier for our clients to do business with us. 
That includes the development of our 
electronic offering in Markets and the 
digitalisation of our Corporate Banking 
client service platform.

Running an efficient and effective business

Achieving better operational performance 
and driving improvements in market share, 
while maintaining cost discipline and driving 
more productive use of capital by recycling 
risk-weighted assets to the highest 
returning opportunities.

Improving returns by growing high 
returning and capital efficient businesses 

Focused growth in areas such as transaction 
banking in Corporate Banking and fee-led 
advisory and equity origination work in 
Banking. We are also developing other 
higher-returning businesses where we see 
opportunities, such as securitised products.

Operating environment

The economic conditions of 2019 continued 
to provide a challenging context for corporate 
and institutional banking and financing 
activity. Features such as the low interest rate 
environment, the UK's withdrawal from the EU 
and global trade tensions combined to 
dampen and delay deal activity, particularly 
primary issuance. 

That meant the global markets revenue pool 
shrank by 2%a in 2019.

Our Banking business has also seen its 
available fee pool shrink, with declines of 
14-18%b compared with 2018 in the UK and 
Europe, and 2-3%b in the Americas and Asia.

We expect many of these macroeconomic 
trends to continue, and are shaping our 
business accordingly. 

Our achievements 
in 2019

Despite the challenging conditions, many of 
our businesses have performed well. We have 
continued to gain market share in Markets and 
Banking and all of our businesses continue to 
deliver for our clients. However, our Corporate 
and Investment Bank as a whole must make 
further progress in generating the returns our 
shareholders expect.

In Markets, we have helped clients navigate 
the volatile trading environment and 
continued to grow despite subdued financial 
markets, with share up 0.2%c in a highly 
competitive environment. 

That was, in part, a result of continued 
investment in our electronic capabilities, 
particularly through investment in our BARX 
and options platforms. We are now partway 
through a multi-year effort to provide our 
clients with market-leading execution 
capabilities and liquidity access, and 
increase the strength of our digital offering.

In Corporate Banking, we have also invested 
in our digital proposition, with over 80% 
of our clients now using iPortal, our digital 
self-service platform, creating a ‘single 
window' for clients to self-serve for many 
day-to-day corporate banking needs through 
a reliable, easy to use interface. 

We have also broadened our business across 
Europe, with our single platform now live 
across seven of our nine target European 
countries, without the overheads of a branch 
network. We continue to focus on capital 
productivity and transaction banking revenue 
growth to improve returns.

In Banking, we saw notable improvements in 
share and revenue in both advisory and equity 
underwriting. In the UK and US, we improved 
our rank to #5b, and globally, improved to #6b. 
Our ambition is to continue to deliver a 
more diversified product mix, and improve 
the proportion of income generated by less 
capital intensive businesses. In this context, 
we increased our global fee share to 4.2%b, 
despite a declining market.

We also continued to invest and evolve to 
meet the changing needs of our clients. This 
saw us create one of the first Sustainable and 
Impact Banking (SIB) teams in the market, 
enabling us to provide thoughtful content and 
execution capabilities to serve the ESG needs 
of our clients.

Our Corporate and Investment Bank aids money 
managers, institutions, governments and corporate 
clients in managing their financial needs.

Focus for 2020 
and beyond

Our strategy puts us on a clear path to evolve 
with the needs of our clients, and in doing so 
to increase returns.

We will continue to focus on growth in 
high-returning, capital efficient parts of our 
business, as well as maintaining our focus 
on cost discipline and operational rigour.

We will also look to make further, selective 
investments for the long term; establishing 
ourselves firmly as the leading European 
Corporate and Investment Bank, competing 
on an even footing with our US peers, and 
operating at the most efficient scale in serving 
our clients.

In Corporate Banking, we will continue the 
investment in our digital proposition and in 
our European offering. We will also focus on 
steadily improving our credit portfolio returns 
by reallocating risk weighted assets to 
higher-returning opportunities.

Markets will continue to focus on growing 
client balances, building a large and stable 
accrual income base. We will keep investing in 
low-touch electronic execution platforms, to 
drive efficiency and scale. We will also broaden 
the reach of our fixed income and equities 
product suite to hedge fund clients, through 
our Prime Brokerage offering. 

Banking will continue to invest in select 
sectors in the US and Europe to improve 
revenue contribution from our equity and 
advisory offerings and help us narrow the 
gap to our US peers.

Following creation of the SIB team, we will 
accelerate our efforts to support growth stage 
companies as well as our broader client base 
on integrating ESG. 

The SIB group will coordinate the ESG 
activities for our clients across Corporate and 
Investment Bank – including our current Green

Committed to sustainable 
finance 
Apple Inc. €2.0bn Green Bond
We continue to lead the market in our 
commitment to sustainable finance 
through our ESG franchise. In November 
2019, we priced a €2.0bn green bond for 
Apple. The transaction was the largest-
ever Euro-denominated green bond 
issued by a US corporate, and the 
second-largest Euro-denominated 
corporate green bond offering of all time. 

Apple intends to use the 
proceeds from the offering 
to finance one or more of 
its ‘Eligible Green Projects': 
mitigating its impact on 
climate change by reducing 
the carbon footprint of its 
supply chain, pioneering 
the use of greener materials 
in its products and processes, 
and conserving resources 
by transitioning to recycled 
and renewable materials for 
production.

We were able to use our expertise in 
green banking and track record of 
success to support Apple in their 
ambitions to support new opportunities 
that will protect the planet in a 
sustainable way. The transaction, among 
many others, demonstrates the role that 
Barclays plays in financing and advising 
on transactions that contribute to a 
sustainable future for us all.

Barclays International:  
Consumer, Cards and Payments

CUSTOMERS AND CLIENTS

Our Consumer, Cards and Payments business 
is at the forefront of the digital economy.

Consumer, Cards and Payments includes 
the following key businesses:

In the UK, our payments business enables 
clients ranging from small businesses to large 
corporates to make and receive payments. We 
are a leading corporate card issuer for large 
and small businesses, and have expanded 
into providing business-to-business supplier 
payment solutions. We also help businesses 
accept payments from their customers 
in-store, in-app and online. We are also  
one of the UK's largest finance partners 
for retailers, providing point-of-sale finance 
solutions to consumers. 

In the US, our co-branded cards business 
provides credit cards to consumers. Our 
partners include American Airlines, JetBlue 
and Wyndham Hotels & Resorts.

In Germany, we offer market-leading 
consumer credit cardsa, while continuing 
to develop our lending offering.

Our Private Bank provides a diverse  
range of personal and institutional wealth 
management products and services, including 
investments, credit and cash management 
solutions.

Strategic priorities

Our strategy is to grow capital efficient 
businesses such as payments. We will also 
grow in other areas of expertise, such as our 
US co-branded credit card business, though 
we have scaled back our presence in Barclays 
branded US credit cards.

We plan to grow our payments business by 
deepening our client relationships through 
tighter integration across Barclays and 
through significant investment in our digital 
and client reporting capabilities, where we 
have historically had gaps.

We will also build upon our deep payments 
experience by integrating with the software 
providers our clients use, in order to scale up 
our payments solutions across the UK and 
into Europe. Further investment in our digital 
infrastructure will be key to continuing to 
simplify processes and make it easy for our 
clients to access an end-to-end payment 
service from Barclays in the UK and across 
Europe.

In our US co-branded cards business,  
we are strengthening our foundations  
through platform upgrades, infrastructure 
improvements and process automation to 
meet evolving customer needs. Our co-
branded business model is well proven and 
is creating opportunities for growth. We 
continue to focus on deeper engagement with 
current partners, whilst expanding our reach 
with new strategic opportunities.

Our Private Bank remains focused on 
delivering bespoke solutions for global 
high-net-worth, ultra-high-net-worth and 
family office clients. We have made a number 
of digital enhancements to streamline 
onboarding for our Private Bank clients and 
this will remain an area of focus.

Operating environment

Market changes are primarily driven by 
changes in consumer behaviour. For example, 
the UK card payment market is growing 
significantly, with a shift from in-store to 
online payments. Digital and e-commerce 
focused players are growing fast and gaining 
market share. 

The continued low interest rate environment 
means consumers are borrowing more, 
creating opportunities for new entrants who 
are focused solely on point-of-sale financing, 
to compete with traditional card issuers 
like Barclays.

Private Banking continues to be highly 
fragmented, and while digital penetration is 
lower than other segments, technology and 
automation are playing an increasing role.

Our achievements 
in 2019

On top of strong partner renewal activity in 
the US, we launched a refreshed Uber credit 
card with new reward features to maximise 
customer engagement and value for our 
partner and cardholders. We also launched 
refreshed American Airlines Aviator Red and 
Silver cards and relaunched our Barclaycard 
Financing Visa – a simplified financing-
focused product for Apple consumers  
in the US.

We have also made progress in upgrading the 
US platform and data infrastructure, which 
has both improved customer experience and 
made our business more efficient. 

In point-of-sale lending in the UK, we have 
worked with Apple to launch the ‘Trade-In-
With-Instalment' solution. This offers 
customers the opportunity to upgrade their 
iPhone through a 24-month instalment loan 
with 0% interest. It is a good example of how 
we are providing value for both consumers 
and our clients.

In our payments business in the UK, we have 
retained key strategic clients and forged new 
partnerships with companies like Coupa and 
TouchBistro, highlighting our unique 
payments integration capabilities.

Barclays is a top-ten 
credit card issuer 
in the US.

We see a third of all 
card payments made 
in the UK, which gives 
us a broad and deep 
understanding of the 
payments environment.

With a third of all card payments made in the 
UKb, Barclays is one of the largest payment 
processors in Europec, and is a leading 
corporate card issuer. We recently won the 
B2B Payments Innovation Award at the 2019 
Payments Awards, which highlights the 
strength of our franchise in payments.

Making it easier for small businesses to 
join our payments network has been at the 
centre of our digital transformation. We have 
successfully streamlined a paper-based 
journey into a digital experience, now with 
same day onboarding for most of our clients.

In the US, we continue to see strong net 
promoter scores. We maintained our ranking 
in the top 10 of US credit card issuersd.

Focus for 2020 
and beyond

We continue to make our businesses more 
digital, meeting the changing needs of clients 
and consumers. We also see opportunities to 
make our businesses more efficient.

We will remain focused in the US on 
upgrading our platform, enabling us to 
transact faster, and create stronger 
foundations for growth, including new 
planned product offerings in consumer 
lending and point-of-sale financing.

Our successful track record with our retail 
partners in the UK serves us well as we 
develop product propositions across our 
payments business. We will also expand our 
acquiring business geographically, particularly 
across Europe.

We have a strong foundation and deep subject 
matter expertise across a wide range of 
businesses and regions. By bringing together 
a number of our efforts, we will unlock further 
growth opportunities for Barclays and deliver 
world-class solutions for our customers.

In the Private Bank, we continue to work 
closely with the CIB to build out further our 
suite of products, with a focus on expanding 
our investment and credit propositions, 
supported by improved digital capabilities.

Next generation fraud 
protection 
Barclaycard Transact
New regulations are introducing 
additional authentication requirements 
for online card payments. This can slow 
down the checkout experience for 
consumers, and sometimes mean they 
abandon their purchase altogether. 

As more transactions move 
online, it is critical to ensure 
higher-risk transactions 
have these higher levels 
of authentication while 
continuing to allow low-risk 
consumer spend to be 
approved seamlessly. 

Launched in September 2019, Transact 
is our new online fraud and payment 
solution. It uses AI to send payments 
through the quickest route – helping our 
corporate clients take payments at the 
speed their customers expect, and 
helping to prevent abandoned 
transactions.

 Female  Male

Under the Companies Act 2006, Barclays is required to 
report on the gender breakdown of our employees and 
‘senior managers'. Our global workforce was 87,369 
(47,392 male, 39,970 female, 7 unavailable), with 107 
senior managers (79 male, 28 female). This is on a 
headcount basis, including colleagues on long-term 
leave. Unavailable refers to colleagues who do not record 
gender in our systems. ‘Senior Managers' represents 
the Group Executive Committee and their direct reports.

Our people make a critical difference to our 
success, and our investment in them protects 
and strengthens our culture. 

We increasingly draw on the latest thinking 
from behavioural science and data science to 
identify what's most likely to be effective in 
hiring, developing and engaging our people, 
and then track effectiveness over time. We're 
also starting to use the same data-driven 
approach to give us a much more accurate 
picture of how people progress through our 
organisation.

Hiring the best people
We continue to focus on hiring people with 
the skills that will help us accelerate the digital 
transformation of our organisation, as well as 
adapt more quickly to the changing needs of 
our customers and clients. 

We have increased hiring across our core 
strategic locations globally. Building a modern, 
scale presence in a smaller number of sites 
enables us to make significant investments in 
the workplace that would not otherwise be 
possible. The transition to having more of our 
people work from these strategic sites means 
change for our existing colleagues. We 
recognise the disruption that this can create 
and we are managing the impacts 
thoughtfully.

Within BX, we continue to rebalance the mix 
of contractors and permanent colleagues, so 
that more people work directly for us. We 
believe this is a competitive advantage and 
further strengthens our culture.

We want to hire from within and are 
increasingly using data and analytics to 
identify and support high performers and 
potential future leaders – particularly from 
those groups that are currently under-
represented amongst our senior colleagues. 
34% of our vacancies were filled by internal 
candidates during 2019.

Just under 900 graduates joined us in 2019, 
enabling us to develop our pipeline of future 
leaders in-house. The percentage of graduate 
female hires was 34%. We also provided over 
300 people with the opportunity to complete 
a structured apprenticeship. 

We have continued to put additional effort 
into supporting people who have been in 
the armed forces to find a career at Barclays, 
through the ‘After' programme. We have also 
supported those returning to the workforce 
after a career break, through our 
‘Encore' programme.

People with different perspectives and life 
experiences make our organisation stronger. 
We are committed to attracting, developing 
and retaining a diverse and inclusive 
workforce, and providing equal opportunities.

We aim to make sure our hiring is as diverse 
as possible. Our policies require us to give full 
and fair consideration to all populations based 
on their aptitudes and abilities. We're using 
data and analytics to better understand how 
we can improve our hiring process. 

We recognise the importance of measuring 
progress around our gender diversity agenda 
and believe that setting targets is an effective 
way to do this. We've set ourselves a target of 
28% female Managing Directors and Directors 
by the end of 2021, and have signed up to the 
Hampton Alexander targets of 33% female 
representation on each of our Boards and 
across our Group Executive Committee (ExCo) 
and their direct reports by the end of 2020. We 
continue to report on our results as part of the 
Hampton Alexander Review and HM Treasury 
Women in Finance Charter. 

We believe that the culture of Barclays is built 
and shaped by the thousands of professionals 
around the world who serve our customers 
and clients with a shared purpose and values.

People with different 
perspectives and life 
experiences make our 
organisation stronger.

Listening to our people
Our regular colleague survey formally 
captures the views of all our people and  
is a key part of how we track colleague 
engagement. Our overall engagement score 
reduced slightly to 77% in 2019, but 80% 
of our colleagues would still recommend 
Barclays as a good place to work. Our 
colleagues also shared that 79% of them 
feel it's safe to speak up to share their views. 

89% of colleagues told us they believe 
Barclays is focused on achieving good 
customer and client outcomes and 86% said 
they are proud of the contribution Barclays 
makes to the community and society. 

Only 61% of our people said the stress levels 
at work are manageable, and 53% believe 
that we have been successful in eliminating 
obstacles to efficiency. Improving these scores 
is a key priority and we are working on the 
underlying problems.

The results from the survey are an important 
part of the conversations our leaders have 
about how we run the business, and it's a 
specific focus for our Executive Committee 
and our Board. The Executive Committee 
holds a dedicated town hall for colleagues 
each year, specifically to talk about their 
feedback and the actions we're taking in 
response, and there are many follow up 
communications and action plans built 
across the Group.

We monitor our culture across the 
organisation, and in individual business areas, 
through culture dashboards. These combine 
colleague survey data with other metrics 
about our business, so that we can see the 
effect our people's engagement has on our 
performance, and on the continued strength 
of our culture. 82% of our people have heard 
or read senior leaders talking about the 
character and culture of Barclays.

Developing talent for the future
We operate in a highly-regulated environment, 
so it's critical to our success that our people 
understand the rules that govern how we 
operate. We invested £36m in training last 
year to ensure we get this right.

A wide range of development opportunities 
are available to help all our people build their 
career, delivered both in-person and through 
our new digital learning platform, Learning 
Lab, which is making development more 
available than ever.

We also launched two new flagship leadership 
development programmes during 2019. This 
is a significant investment in our future 
leaders, driven by our core belief that quality 
leadership makes a difference to our success. 
We track the progression of people that have 
participated in these programmes to see how 
effective they are. 

We remain committed to closing pay gaps at 
Barclays; the difference in seniority between 
male and female colleagues, and between 
BAME and non-BAME colleagues. You can 
find out more about this in our Pay Gaps 
Report, available at barclays.com

Colleague engagement
We have an established approach to engaging 
colleagues which includes the majority of 
the UK's Financial Reporting Council (FRC) 
recommendations, and is in line with new 
governance requirements in 2019. This 
ensures that we understand their perspective, 
take it into account in our decision making at 
the most senior level, and share with them our 
strategy and progress.

That extends to those who work for us 
indirectly as well, such as contractors, 
although in a more limited way. In 2020, 
our supplier code of conduct will require 
organisations with more than 250 employees 
to demonstrate that they have an effective 
workforce engagement approach of their own.

It's important to us that our Board members 
are engaged with our people – directly, and 
indirectly through our management team. 

We regularly report on our colleague 
engagement activity to our Boards. 

Together with direct engagement, this 
comprehensive reporting approach and 
dedicated time at board meetings helps 
our Board take the issues of interest to 
our colleagues into account in their 
decision making.

This has enabled them to confirm that our 
workforce engagement approach is effective.

Our people and culture
COLLEAGUES

Keeping our people informed
In addition to these data sources, our leaders, 
including our Board, engage face-to-face with 
colleagues locally to hear what they think. 
That might be through site visits, large-scale 
town halls, training and development 
activity, mentoring, informal breakfast 
sessions, committee membership, diversity 
and well-being programmes, or focus and 
consultative groups.

We make sure we're regularly keeping 
everyone up to date on the strategy, 
performance and progress of the organisation 
through a strategically-coordinated, multi-
channel approach across a combination of 
leader-led engagement, and digital and print 
communication, including blogs, vlogs and 
podcasts. 

We also engage with our people collectively 
through a strong and effective partnership 
with Unite, as well as the Barclays Group 
European Forum, which represents all 
colleagues within the European Union. 

These conversations help us to deliver 
things like a collective pay deal for our Unite 
covered colleagues, who represent 84% of our 
UK-based colleagues, as well as more complex 
business change and our long-term focus on 
colleague well-being. 

We regularly brief our union partners on the 
strategy and progress of the business and 
seek their input on ways in which we can 
improve the colleague experience of working 
for Barclays. The collective bargaining 
coverage of Unite in the UK represents 
c.52% of our global workforce.

When we make significant changes to our 
business, they can affect our people and 
can mean that redundancies are necessary. 
We consult in detail with colleague 
representatives on major change programmes 
affecting our people. We do this to help us 
minimise compulsory job losses wherever 
possible, including through voluntary 
redundancy and redeployment.

Our people policies
Another way we shape the culture of our 
organisation is through our people policies, 
which are reviewed regularly, including by 
our Board.

Our policies are designed to provide equal 
opportunities and create an inclusive culture, 
in line with our values and in support of our 
long-term success. They also reflect relevant 
employment law, including the provisions of 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
and ILO Declaration on Fundamental 
Principles and Rights at Work.

We expect our people to treat each other 
with dignity and respect, and do not tolerate 
discrimination, bullying, harassment or 
victimisation on any grounds. 

We are committed to paying our people fairly 
and equitably relative to their role, skills, 
experience and performance – in a way that 
balances the needs of all our stakeholders. 
That means our remuneration policies reward 
sustainable performance that's in line with 
our purpose and values, as well as our risk 
expectations. You can find more information 
in our Fair Pay Report, available on 
barclays.com

We encourage our people to benefit from 
Barclays' performance by enrolling in our 
share plans, further strengthening their 
commitment to the organisation.

The Directors' Remuneration Report sets 
out updates on remuneration outcomes and 
developments during 2019. It also explains 
our plans for 2020, including our proposed 
new Directors' Remuneration Policy, which 
will be subject to a vote at the next AGM.

We are committed 
to paying people fairly 
– in a way that balances 
the needs of all our 
stakeholders.

The tools to succeed
We provide tools, programmes and support 
that enable colleagues to balance their 
work-life with their personal commitments, 
supporting career development opportunities 
at each life stage.

We offer enhanced maternity, paternity, 
adoption and shared parental entitlements.

We're continuing to shape a more agile, 
technology-led culture through dynamic 
working, so that we can meet our people's 
desire to work more flexibly. 88% of 
colleagues say they are able to work 
dynamically and this is one of the biggest 
drivers for overall engagement, with more 
favourable scores across all questions. 

However, our people also told us that we need 
to invest more in the technology and services 
we use internally. Only 56% of people said 
they have the work tools and resources they 
need to achieve excellent performance and 
this is a reduction year over year. We've made 
significant progress particularly in our new 
strategic campus sites, but we need to get the 
balance right between required investment 
and cost discipline in order to effectively 
balance the needs of all of our stakeholder 
groups.

We're replacing the old devices that we know 
our people can find frustrating, and we're 
updating our software and connectivity so 
that getting work done is easier. We've also 
invested in the technology support we provide 
to our people, so that when things do go 
wrong, we can put them right more quickly. 

Over the next few years, our focus will be on 
enabling much greater collaboration, right 
across the organisation, so that we can unlock 
the power of the connections between our 
people.

Building a supportive culture
Diversity of thought and experience works 
best when everyone feels included. People 
who feel they can be themselves at work are 
happier and more productive, so we believe 
that creating an inclusive and diverse culture 
isn't just the right thing to do, but is also best 
for our business.

We focus on five areas: disability, gender, 
LGBT+, multicultural, and multigenerational. 
Each of these is represented and championed 
by a senior leader, and embedded deeply 
into the organisation through colleague 
networks organised by our people and 
funded by Barclays. 

Our networks provide colleagues with 
valuable support and advice, create 
development opportunities, and raise 
awareness of issues and challenges. Our 
networks also influence our people policies, 
teaching us how we need to adapt to give our 
people the support they need to succeed. 85% 
of our colleagues say that they feel included 
within their teams.

Our policies require managers to give full and 
fair consideration to those with a disability 
on the basis of their aptitudes and abilities; 
both when hiring and through ongoing 
people management, as well as ensuring 
opportunities for training, career development 
and promotion are available to all. As part of 
the UK government Disability Confident 
scheme, we encourage applications from 
people with a disability, or a physical or 
mental health condition.

We encourage everyone working at Barclays, 
or thinking about joining us, to tell us what 
support and adjustments they need to be their 
best at work. We're working hard to make the 
processes that support this more effective, 
recognising that at times getting the support 
colleagues need can be slow. 

We track the ever-changing composition of 
our people through online dashboards, to 
make sure that our senior leaders understand 
the diverse makeup and needs of the 
organisation they lead. We're also an inaugural 
signatory of the UK's Race at Work Charter. 

Through our BeWell programme, we provide 
expert advice and guidance on the practical 
steps colleagues can take to look after their 
physical and mental health. In 2020, our 
Mental Health Awareness training will become 
mandatory for all colleagues. We were one 
of the first businesses to sign up to the 
Mental Health at Work Commitment. 74% 
of colleagues say that Barclays supports 
employee efforts to enhance their well-being.

a   BAME populations include Asian, Mixed, Black, 
Hispanic/Latino, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific 
Islander and Native American colleagues. 
Employees with an undeclared ethnicity (21% of 
our global population) have been excluded from 
all calculations, both for 2019 and 2018.

Stakeholder focus on the societal impact 
of businesses on wider ESG factors has 
continued to evolve rapidly during 2019. 
Investors, customers and clients, regulators, 
policymakers and broader society are all 
accelerating the pace of change.

We continue to strengthen the integration 
of social and environmental issues into 
our business strategy. Demonstrating the 
growing strategic importance of these issues, 
the Group Executive Committee created the 
Environmental and Social Impact (ESI) 
Committee in June 2019 to manage 
environmental and social matters. Chaired by 
the Group Chief Executive, with representation 
from business and function leadership, the 
Committee provides strategic management 
oversight, sets our approach and monitors 
execution against priorities.

Sometimes, that will take the form of an 
unambiguous statement of intent – as we 
have made through our Energy and Climate 
Change Statement. Often, though, the mark 
of our contribution will be seen most clearly 
in the way we run our business.

We believe we can make a difference in four 
key ways.

1.  Making growth ‘green', 
sustainable and inclusive

Banks help to finance the future. In the way 
we prioritise and mobilise financial resources, 
and in how we do business, we can help 
shape the future to be cleaner, fairer and 
leave no one behind.

Social and environmental financing
We continue to make good progress towards 
our social and environmental financing 
commitment, having provided £34.8bn of 
social and environmental financing in 2019 
(2018: £28.5bn), facilitating a total of £63.3bn 
towards our £150bn goal. Social financing 
was £23.9bn (69% of total), environmental 
financing was £7.8bn (22% of total). 

Supra-national, national and regional 
development institution finance continues 
to be a key driver of the £23.9bn in social 
financing (up 9% from £21.8bn in 2018).

Sustainability-linked loans, which can be 
linked to a range of different social and 
environmental performance metrics, increased 
to £3.1bn. These loans doubled year on year 
as more clients integrate sustainability metrics 
into their loan facilities. 

Environmental financing grew by 45% year on 
year to a total of £7.8bn (2018: £5.3bn). We 
have seen good growth across our product set 
in our consumer and wholesale businesses.

Accessible retail products and services
We believe that banking should work for 
everyone.

There were more than 570,000 Barclays Basic 
Current Accounts open at the end of 2019, 
serving the financial needs of those who 
wouldn't otherwise qualify for an account.

We also provide free banking to over 130,000 
small not-for-profit organisations through our 
Community Accounts, including sports and 
community clubs, religious groups, and 
local charities.

Our success over the long term is 
tied inextricably to the preservation 
of our environment and the progress 
of our communities.

To help keep our customers safe, we've 
invested millions of pounds in multi-layered 
security systems that protect against fraud 
and scams. We prevent thousands of 
attempted fraudulent transactions every day, 
and stopped over £720 million of fraud from 
taking place in the past year alone.

Our customers are increasingly choosing to 
access our products and services digitally, and 
using our branches less and less. That means 
we must constantly assess how and why our 
branches are used, and make commercial 
decisions based on that information.

Where we take the difficult decision to  
close a branch, we work closely with the local 
community to understand their needs and any 
alternative solutions we can provide. These 
solutions will be specific to each area but 
may include cashback from local retailers, 
arrangements with the nearest Post Office, or 
pop-up branches, as well as Barclays Collect 
for businesses, video banking, fully-automated 
facilities or cash machines. We also work 
closely with customers in communities across 
the UK to help them access and feel confident 
in using our digital services through our team 
of Barclays Digital Eagles.

In October 2019, we made a commitment to 
freeze branch closures for ‘last-in-town' and 
remote locations, protecting 105 branches for 
at least two years, and we will maintain a full 
service proposition for our customers through 
the Post Office for the next three years.

2.  Managing our social and 
environmental impact

The scale and scope of the support we provide 
to our customers and clients means that we 
can have a significant impact on the world 
around us. We take seriously our obligations 
to manage that impact responsibly.

As a bank, our potential adverse 
environmental and social impacts are 
frequently indirect, arising from the provision 
of financial services to business customers 
operating in sensitive sectors. We believe 
that appropriate risk management of these 
environmental and social impacts is not 
only the right thing to do, but ensures the 
longevity of our business and our ability to 
serve our clients.

Environmental and social risks are governed 
and managed as part of Barclays' credit risk 
and reputation risk management frameworks 
and processes. These include the client 
transaction review process, which is 
managed by a dedicated Environmental Risk 
Management team, as part of the central 
Credit Risk Management function, as well 
as the Group Sustainability and Reputation 
risk teams.

Our approach to environmental and social 
risk management is based on a combination 
of statements, standards and guidance. 
Formal position statements are developed in 
consultation with numerous stakeholders and 
aligned with industry best practices. We have 
also developed internal standards to 
implement our position statements.

Adherence is confirmed through pre-contract 
attestation. Further, Barclays PLC is a signatory 
to the Prompt Payment Code in the UK, 
committing to pay our suppliers within clearly 
defined terms. In 2019, we achieved 85% 
(2018: 82.1%) on-time payment by value to 
our suppliers, meeting our public commitment 
to the suppliers of 85%.

IT failures and resilience
Technology plays an increasingly important 
role in how we deliver for our customers 
and clients.

The stability and resilience of our technology 
systems has a direct impact on the quality of 
our service. We make significant investments 
in our infrastructure to guard against risk 
ranging from large scale data corruption, 
to hacking and third party failure.

Our multi-channel approach to delivering 
for our customers provides a level of 
resilience, and we maintain and regularly 
test comprehensive recovery plans to be 
used in the event of a failure.

 4. Investing in our communities
A strong, inclusive economy is a better 
economy for everyone. A vibrant, skilled 
workforce ensures that businesses can thrive, 
and that individuals, along with their families 
and wider communities, can achieve financial 
independence and security.

We are helping to build skills and break down 
barriers to work wherever we find them, to 
enable people to succeed now and in the 
future. We do that through our flagship 
programmes.

LifeSkills gives people across the UK the 
skills, knowledge and confidence they need 
to be ready for the world of work – now 
and in future.

We've already helped millions of people 
through the programme since 2013 and are 
committed to helping a further 10 million 
people by 2022. We have made good progress 
towards our target, with 2.3m upskilled 
through the Life Skills programme in 2019.

Connect with Work provides people from 
often overlooked communities with vital work 
skills, and connects them to businesses that 
are recruiting, including Barclays' clients 
and suppliers.

By the end of 2019 we helped 66,000 people 
around the world into work with 4,200 
businesses. We aspire to have placed 250,000 
people into work through the programme 
by 2022.

3.  Running a responsible business
We know that trust is earned by repeatedly 
doing the right thing. Our approach to 
governance is built to reinforce that trust. 
We believe the best way to build that trust is 
to invest in our culture and support our people 
in the choices they make every day with 
guidance and policies that help.

That starts with our purpose and our values, 
and is locked into our organisation through 
The Barclays Way. The Barclays Way is the 
touchstone for everyone in Barclays on the 
standard of conduct we expect, and sets a 
tone from the top that is unequivocal about 
who we are and what we stand for.

Whistleblowing
Most employees feel comfortable raising 
concerns through the usual escalation 
channels: their line manager, as well as 
Compliance, Legal and HR contacts.

If employees prefer to raise an issue in 
confidence, including a formal whistleblowing 
issue, we have a dedicated ‘Raising Concerns' 
team that employees can contact which direct 
their issue to the most appropriate team.

Whistleblowing reports will be directed to 
a dedicated, confidential and independent 
whistleblowing team to investigate.

In 2019, the whistleblowing team opened 
a total of 254 whistleblowing investigations 
(2018: 364), with the majority of the 
investigations focused on allegations of 
breaches of controls or processes. Of the 217 
whistleblowing investigations closed in 2019, 
28% were found to have some level of 
substantiation.

Managing our supply chain
14,000 companies from more than 26 
countries supply Barclays across a broad 
range of products and services. Nearly 90% 
of our third party spend is concentrated in 
the UK and US.

Our supply base is diverse, including  
start-ups, small and medium-sized businesses, 
businesses owned, controlled and operated by 
under-represented segments of local societies 
as well as multinational corporations. Many 
of our suppliers have their own extensive 
supply chains.

Our engagement with suppliers is important. 
The Directors have regard, via management 
oversight, to the need to foster business 
relationships with suppliers and, as such, 
engage with them to ensure adherence to 
the Barclays' Supplier Code of Conduct and 
Supply Control obligations which cover our 
expectations of suppliers. 

Our role in society
SOCIETY

Eagle Labs is a UK network of  
branch-based spaces that support individuals 
and businesses to innovate and grow. 
Eagle Labs are helping drive transformation 
in SMEs and across industry sectors, through 
local collaborations with industry-leading 
companies, universities and start-ups.

Unreasonable Impact is a partnership between 
Barclays and the Unreasonable Group. It helps 
fast-growing, social and environment-focused 
companies globally to accelerate their 
business and create hundreds of new jobs 
while solving some of society's most 
pressing problems.

With advice and guidance from a 
community of world-class mentors and 
industry specialists, the programme has so 
far supported 124 growth-stage ventures. 

By 2022, we aspire to have supported 
250 high-growth businesses through 
Unreasonable Impact.

Alongside these high-impact programmes, 
we also support our employees to make a 
difference on the issues that matter most to 
them personally, by supporting them to 
volunteer their time and skills in their own 
community and matching their financial 
contribution with our own.

Building Thriving 
Local Economies
Our Thriving Local Economies initiative 
aims to identify the drivers and barriers 
to local economic success and enables 
Barclays to support those economies to 
thrive beyond the provisioning of our 
day-to-day products and services. In 
2019 Taunton Deane, in the South West 
of England, joined Bury and Kilmarnock 
as our pilot communities. During the 
three-year programme, we are working 
closely with local councils, schools and 
business groups in those communities to 
better understand what help and support 
they need to thrive.

Developing the Principles 
for Responsible Banking 
The Principles for Responsible Banking (PRB) 
provide a single framework for the global 
banking industry to embed sustainability 
at strategic, portfolio and transactional levels, 
and across all business areas. The Principles 
help to align banks with society's goals, as 
expressed in the Paris Climate Agreement  
and the United Nations' Sustainable 
Development Goals.

As one of the 30 founding banks, we are 
proud to have partnered to help develop and 
support the Principles. We recognise that 
implementing the Principles will be a journey 
and we will continue to embed the Principles 
into our business. We will provide initial 
disclosures on how Barclays is responding to 
the Principles as part of our ESG Report and 
associated disclosures.

Supporting UK Business
When the customers, clients and communities 
we serve succeed, Barclays succeeds. This is 
particularly true in the United Kingdom, where 
we have been part of the fabric of the country 
for over 325 years.

As our home market experienced uncertainty 
around Brexit through the year, we continued 
to support local businesses and communities 
through this period of change.

From farmers embracing the fourth industrial 
revolution to manufacturers forging trade 
links in new markets, small, medium and 
large businesses across the UK continue 
to demonstrate ambition, innovation 
and resilience.

To help them fulfil their potential, we launched 
our dedicated support package for small and 
medium-sized businesses (SMEs) – the 
lifeblood of the economy. This included a 
dedicated £14.7bn SME lending fund, our 
1,500-strong team of on-the-ground 
relationship managers and over 200 Brexit and 
Beyond clinics, held across the country. We 
have already lent £3.8bn to SMEs during 2019. 

ESG and climate-related 
disclosures
Barclays supports the goals 
of the Paris Agreement, 
and we recognise the role 
that banks must play in 
assisting the transition to 
a low-carbon economy. 
This can be accomplished 
through the provision of 
products and services which 
mobilise the capital required 
to execute this transition, 
and better management of 
climate-related risk within 
our portfolio. 
We will be publishing a full 
suite of ESG and climate-related 
disclosures later this year, 
including an updated climate 
change position, ESG Report 
and separate TCFD publication.

As our home 
market experienced 
uncertainty around 
Brexit, we continued 
to support local 
businesses and 
communities through 
this period of change.

Financial metrics 
Group RoTE
RoTE measures our ability to generate 
acceptable returns for shareholders. It is 
calculated as profit after tax attributable 
to ordinary shareholders as a proportion 
of average shareholders' equity excluding 
non-controlling interests and other equity 
instruments adjusted for the deduction of 
intangible assets and goodwill.

This measure indicates the return generated 
by the management of the business based 
on shareholders' tangible equity. Achieving a 
target RoTE demonstrates the organisation's 
ability to execute its strategy and to align 
management's interests with those of its 
shareholders. RoTE lies at the heart of the 
Group's capital allocation and performance 
management process.

CET1 ratio
The CET1 ratio is a measure of the capital 
strength and resilience of Barclays. The 
Group's capital management objective is 
to maximise shareholder value by prudently 
managing the level and mix of its capital. 
This is to ensure the Group and all of its 
subsidiaries are appropriately capitalised 
relative to their minimum regulatory and 
stressed capital requirements, and to support 
the Group's risk appetite, growth, and 
strategic options while seeking to maintain 
a robust credit proposition for the Group 
and its subsidiaries.

The ratio expresses the Group's CET1 capital 
as a percentage of its risk weighted assets 
(RWAs). RWAs are a measure of the Group's 
assets adjusted for their associated risks.

Operating expenses
Barclays views operating expenses as a key 
strategic area for banks; those which actively 
manage costs and control them effectively 
will gain a strong competitive advantage. 

Cost: income ratio
The cost: income ratio measures operating 
expenses as a percentage of total income 
and is used to assess the productivity of 
our business operations.

Our performance in 2019
Group RoTE
RoTE, excluding litigation and conduct, 
increased to 9.0% (2018: 8.5%), in line with 
the 2019 target. Based on an average target 
CET1 ratioa of 13.2%, RoTE was also 9.0%. 

We continue to target greater than 10% RoTE. 
Notwithstanding global macroeconomic 
uncertainty and the current low interest rate 
environment, we believe we can achieve a 
meaningful improvement in returns in 2020.

CET1 ratio
The CET1 ratio increased to 13.8% 
(December 2018: 13.2%).

CET1 capital decreased by £0.3bn to 
£40.8bn. This was driven by underlying profit 
generation of £5.0bn offset by dividends 
paid and foreseen of £2.4bn, an additional 
provision for PPI of £1.4bn, pension deficit 
reduction contribution payments of £0.5bn, 
a decrease in the currency translation reserve 
of £0.5bn, mainly driven by the depreciation 
of period end USD against GBP, and a loss 
on the redemption of Additional Tier 1 (AT1) 
securities of £0.4bn.

RWAs decreased by £16.8bn to £295.1bn 
primarily driven by the reduction in the 
Group's operational risk RWAs, as well as the 
depreciation of period end USD against GBP.

The Group continues to target a CET1 ratio 
of c.13.5%. 

Operating expenses
Operating expenses decreased to £13,585m 
(2018: £13,896m) in line with 2019 guidance, 
as cost efficiencies were partially offset by 
continued investment. 

Cost: income ratio
Barclays UK and Barclays International each 
generated positive cost: income jaws, resulting 
in the Group cost: income ratio, excluding 
litigation and conduct, reducing to 63% 
(2018: 66%).

Cost control remains a priority and 
management continues to target a cost: 
income ratio of less than 60% over time.

Barclays delivered year on year improved RoTE 
of 9.0%. This represents the third consecutive 
year of improved underlying RoTE performance.

Enterprise Risk 
Management Framework 
At Barclays, risks are identified and overseen 
through the Enterprise Risk Management 
Framework (ERMF), which supports the 
business in its aim to embed effective 
risk management and a strong risk 
management culture.

The ERMF governs the way in which Barclays 
identifies and manages its risks.

The management of risk is then embedded 
into each level of the business, with all 
colleagues being responsible for identifying 
and controlling risk.

Risk appetite
Risk appetite defines the level of risk we are 
prepared to accept across the different risk 
types, taking into consideration varying 
levels of financial and operational stress. 
Risk appetite is key to our decision-making 
processes, including ongoing business 
planning and setting of strategy, new product 
approvals and business change initiatives.

Three lines of defence
The first line of defence is comprised of the 
revenue generating and client-facing areas, 
along with all associated support functions, 
including Finance, Treasury, Human Resources 
and Operations and Technology. The first line 
identifies the risks, sets the controls and 
escalates risk events to the second line 
of defence.

The second line of defence is made up of Risk 
and Compliance and oversees the first line by 
setting limits, rules and constraints on their 
operations, consistent with the risk appetite.

The third line of defence is comprised 
of Internal Audit, providing independent 
assurance to the Board and Executive 
Committee on the effectiveness of 
governance, risk management and control 
over current, systemic and evolving risks.

Although the Legal function does not sit 
in any of the three lines, it works to support 
them all and plays a key role in overseeing 
legal risk throughout the bank. The Legal 
function is also subject to oversight from the 
Risk and Compliance functions (second line) 
with respect to the management of 
operational and conduct risks.

Monitoring the risk profile
Together with a strong governance process, 
using business and Group level Risk 
Committees as well as Board level forums, 
the Board receives regular information in 
respect of the risk profile of the Group, and 
has ultimate responsibility for Group risk 
appetite and capital plans. Information 
received includes measures of risk profile 
against risk appetite as well as the 
identification of new and emerging risks.

In 2019, Barclays also conducted a group-
wide, exploratory stress test against a severe 
but plausible near-term climate scenario. 
The aim of the analysis was to identify key 
vulnerabilities that were most relevant and 
material to the Group's business model and 
geographical footprint.

We believe that our structure and governance 
supports us in managing risk in the changing 
economic, political and market environments.

Barclays is exposed to internal and external risks 
as part of our ongoing activities. These risks are 
managed as part of our business model.

38 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2019 home.barclays/annualreport

The ERMF defines eight principal risks How risks are managed

Financial principal risks
Credit risk The risk of loss to the Group from the failure of clients, 

customers or counterparties, including sovereigns, to fully 
honour their obligations to the Group, including the whole 
and timely payment of principal, interest, collateral and 
other receivables.

Credit risk teams identify, evaluate, sanction, limit and 
monitor various forms of credit exposure, individually 
and in aggregate.

Market risk The risk of loss arising from potential adverse changes in the 
value of the Group's assets and liabilities from fluctuation in 
market variables including, but not limited to, interest rates, 
foreign exchange, equity prices, commodity prices, credit 
spreads, implied volatilities and asset correlations.

A range of complementary approaches are used to 
identify and evaluate Market risk and to capture 
exposure to Market risk. These are measured, controlled 
and monitored by Market risk specialists.

Treasury and 
Capital risk

Liquidity risk:
The risk that the Group is unable to meet its contractual or 
contingent obligations or that it does not have the appropriate 
amount, tenor and composition of funding and liquidity to 
support its assets.

Capital risk:
The risk that the Group has an insufficient level or 
composition of capital to support its normal business 
activities and to meet its regulatory capital requirements 
under normal operating environments or stressed conditions 
(both actual and as defined for internal planning or regulatory 
testing purposes). This includes the risk from the Group's 
pension plans.

Interest rate risk in the banking book:
The risk that the Group is exposed to capital or income 
volatility because of a mismatch between the interest rate 
exposures of its (non-traded) assets and liabilities.

Treasury and Capital risk is identified and managed 
by specialists in Capital Planning, Liquidity, Asset and 
Liability Management and Market risk. A range of 
approaches are used appropriate to the risk, such as: 
limits; plan monitoring; internal and external 
stress testing.

Non-financial principal risks
Operational risk The risk of loss to the Group from inadequate or failed 

processes or systems, human factors or due to external 
events where the root cause is not due to Credit or 
Market risks.

Operational risk comprises the following risks; data 
management and information, execution risk, financial 
reporting, fraud, payments processing, people, physical 
security, premises, prudential regulation, supplier, tax, 
technology and transaction operations. 

It is not always cost effective or possible to attempt to 
eliminate all operational risks. 

Operational risk is managed across the businesses and 
functions through an internal control environment with 
a view to limiting the risk to acceptable residual levels.

Model risk The risk of potential adverse consequences from financial 
assessments or decisions based on incorrect or misused 
model outputs and reports.

Models are independently validated and approved prior 
to implementation and their performance is monitored 
on a continual basis.

Conduct risk The risk of detriment to customers, clients, market integrity, 
effective competition or Barclays from the inappropriate 
supply of financial services, including instances of wilful or 
negligent misconduct.

The Compliance function sets the minimum standards 
required, and provides oversight to monitor that these 
risks are effectively managed and escalated where 
appropriate.

Reputation risk The risk that an action, transaction, investment, event, 
decision or business relationship will reduce trust in the 
Group's integrity and/or competence.

Reputation risk is managed by embedding our purpose 
and values and maintaining a controlled culture within 
the Group, with the objective of acting with integrity, 
enabling strong and trusted relationships with customers 
and clients, colleagues and broader society.

Legal risk The risk of loss or imposition of penalties, damages or fines 
from the failure of the Group to meet its legal obligations 
including regulatory or contractual requirements.

The Legal function supports colleagues in identifying 
and limiting legal risks.

Provision 31 of the 2018 UK 
Corporate Governance Code
The financial statements and accounts have 
been prepared on a going concern basis.

In addition, Provision 31 of the 2018 UK 
Corporate Governance Code requires the 
Directors to make a statement in the Annual 
Report regarding the viability of the Group, 
including an explanation of how they assessed 
the prospects of the Group, the period of time 
for which they have made the assessment 
and why they consider that period to 
be appropriate.

Time horizon
In light of the analysis summarised below, 
the Board has assessed the Group's current 
viability, and confirms that the Directors have 
a reasonable expectation that the Group will 
be able to continue in operation and meet 
its liabilities as they fall due over the next 
three years. This time frame is used in 
management's Working Capital and Viability 
Report (WCR), prepared at February 2020. The 
availability of the WCR gives management and 
the Board sufficient visibility and confidence 
on the future operating environment for this 
time period. The three-year time frame has 
also been chosen because:

■■ it is within the period covered by the 
Group's formal projections of profitability, 
cash flows, capital requirements and 
capital resources

■■ it is also within the period over which 
regulatory and internal stress testing 
is carried out

■■ it is representative of the level 
of anticipated regulatory change in the 
financial services industry.

The Directors are satisfied that this period is 
sufficient to enable a reasonable assessment 
of viability to be made.

Considerations
In making its assessment the Board has:

■■ carried out a robust and detailed 
assessment of the Group's risk profile 
and material existing and emerging risks

■■  notable among these are risks which 
senior management believe could cause 
the Group's future results of operations 
or financial condition to differ materially 
from current expectations or could 
adversely impact the Group's ability to 
meet regulatory requirements

■■ reviewed how those risks are identified, 
managed and controlled (further detail 
provided on pages 139 to 146)

■■ considered the WCR which provides an 
assessment of forecast CET1, leverage, 
Tier 1 and total capital ratios, as well as the 
build-up of MREL up to the end of 2022

■■ reviewed the Group's liquidity and funding 
profile, including forecasts of the Group's 
internal liquidity risk appetite (LRA) 
and regulatory liquidity coverage ratios

■■ considered the Group's viability under 
specific internal and regulatory stress 
scenarios

■■ considered the stability of the major 
markets in which it operates, supply 
chain resiliency and regulatory changes

■■ considered the sustainability of capital 
distributions

■■ considered scenarios which might affect 
the operational resiliency of the Group

■■ reviewed the draft statutory accounts 
and the in-depth disclosure of the financial 
performance of the Group

■■ considered the Group's medium-term plan
■■ reviewed the possible impact of legal, 

competition and regulatory matters set out 
in Note 26 to the financial statements on 
pages 303 to 306.

Assessment
Risks faced by the Group's business, 
including in respect of financial, conduct and 
operational risk, are controlled and managed 
within the Group in line with the ERMF. 
Executive management set a risk appetite for 
the Group, which is then approved by the 
Board. Risk and Compliance set limits, within 
which businesses are required to operate. 
Management and the Board then oversee the 
ongoing risk profile. Internal Audit provide 
independent assurance to the Board and 
Executive Committee over the effectiveness 
of governance, risk management and control 
over current and evolving risks.

A full set of material risks to which the 
organisation is exposed can be found in 
the material existing and emerging risks on 
pages 129 to 137. Certain risks are additionally 
identified as key themes and monitored 
closely by the Board and Board Committees. 
These are chosen on the basis of their ability 
to impact viability over the time frame of the 
assessment but in some instances the risks 
exist beyond this time frame.

These particular risks include:

■■ the consequences of the UK's exit from 
the EU are unpredictable and diverse, 
difficult to predict and may impact over a 
prolonged period. In particular, a significant 
deterioration in the macroeconomic 
environment in the UK and Europe could 
lead to increased credit rating downgrades 
of the UK sovereign and the Group, 
significantly increasing borrowing costs, 
widening credit spreads and could 
materially adversely affect the Group's 
interest margins and liquidity position

■■ legal proceedings, competition, regulatory 
and conduct matters giving rise to the 
potential risk of fines, loss of regulatory 
licences and permissions and other 
sanctions, as well as potential adverse 
impacts on our reputation with clients 
and customers and on investor confidence 
and/or potentially resulting in impacts 
on capital, liquidity and funding

Viability statement

https://home.barclays/investor-relations/reports-and-events/annual-reports/
<Page End><Page Start>
40 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2019 home.barclays/annualreport

■■ sudden shocks or geopolitical unrest in any 
of the major economies in which the bank 
operates which could impact credit ratings, 
alter the behaviour of depositors and other 
counterparties and affect the ability of the 
firm to maintain appropriate capital and 
liquidity ratios

■■ evolving operational risks (notably 
cybersecurity, technology and resilience) 
and the ability to respond to the new 
and emerging technologies in a 
controlled fashion.

As a universal bank with a diversified and 
connected portfolio of businesses, servicing 
customers and clients globally, the Group is 
impacted in the longer term by a wide range 
of macroeconomic, political, regulatory and 
accounting, technological, social and 
environmental developments. The evolving 
operating environment presents opportunities 
and risks which we continue to evaluate and 
take steps to appropriately adapt our strategy 
and its delivery. Notably, the consequences of 
the withdrawal of the UK from the EU and the 
associated economic and operational risks 
have received significant management 
attention, particularly, given the greater 
uncertainty this is likely to cause in 2020 
and beyond.

Stress tests
The Board has also considered the Group's 
viability under specific internal and regulatory 
stress scenarios.

The Board reviewed external regulatory stress 
test results which are designed to assess the 
resilience of banks to adverse economic 
developments and confirm that we have 
robust forward-looking planning processes for 
the risks associated with our business profile.

In addition, the latest macroeconomic internal 
stress test, conducted in Q4 2019, considered 
the potential impacts of:

■■ a severe UK recession triggered by the 
UK leaving the EU with no transitional 
arrangements, including falling property 
prices which fail to recover over the 
forecast horizon and rising unemployment

■■ the US entering into a recession of similar 
magnitude to the UK, with heightened 
levels of concern over consumer and 
corporate debt as a result of the ongoing 
US-China trade dispute

■■ weakness in peripheral Europe driven 
by weakening in global demand with 
heightened trade tensions and ballooning 
debt burdens in Italy and Spain, the threat 
of a populist uprising beginning to 
dominate the political landscape,

all of which could result in, among other 
things, a loss of income or increased 
impairment. The stress test outcome for 
macroeconomic tests shows our full financial 
performance over the horizon of the scenario 
and focuses on the CET1 capital ratio.

In addition, Barclays conducted a group-wide, 
exploratory stress test against a severe but 
plausible near-term climate scenario. The aim 
of the analysis was to identify key 
vulnerabilities that were most relevant and 
material to the Group's business model and 
geographical footprint.

Legal proceedings, competition, regulatory and 
remediation/redress conduct matters are also 
assessed as part of the stress testing process. 
Capital and liquidity risk appetite are set at a 
level designed to enable the Group to 
withstand various stress scenarios. As part 
of this process, management also identified 
actions, including cost reductions and 
withdrawal from lines of business, available 
to restore the Group to its desired capital 
flightpath.

The Group-wide stress testing framework 
also includes reverse stress testing techniques 
which aim to identify and analyse the 
circumstances under which the Group's 
business model would no longer be viable. 
Examples include extreme macroeconomic 
downturn scenarios, or specific idiosyncratic 
events, covering operational risk (for example, 
cyberattack), adverse outcomes in legal 
proceedings, competition, regulatory and 
conduct matters and capital/liquidity events.

We use an inventory of models, quantitative 
procedures and judgement to support the 
stress test calculations and projections. These 
tools range from experienced management 
judgement through to sophisticated financial 
and behavioural models. The stress test 
evaluation process produces both gross 
impacts and the effect of mitigation including 
management actions. This enables us to 
understand, monitor and control the risks 
identified. The stress testing process is 
overseen by a governance structure from the 
Board through executive business and risk 
committees. Management believes that the 
internal and external stress testing process 
considers a wide range of severe but plausible 
events. However, stress tests should not be 
assumed to be an exhaustive assessment 
of all possible hypothetical extreme or 
remote scenarios.

These internal and external stress tests 
informed the conclusions of the WCR. 
Based on current forecasts, incorporating key 
known regulatory changes to be enacted and 
having considered possible stress scenarios, 
the current liquidity and capital position of 
the Group continues to support the Board's 
assessment of the Group's viability.

We use a variety of tools to track and measure our strategic delivery, and collect both quantitative and qualitative information to get the full picture 
of our performance.

The Non-Financial Reporting requirements contained in sections 414CA and 414CB of the Companies Act 2006 are addressed within this section 
by means of cross reference in order to indicate which part of the strategic narrative the respective requirements are embedded. We have used 
cross referencing as appropriate to deliver clear, concise and transparent reporting.

We have a range of policies and guidance (also available at home.barclays/esg) that support our key outcomes for all of our stakeholders. 
Performance against our strategic non-financial performance measures, as shown on pages 18 to 35, is one indicator of the effectiveness and 
outcome of policies and guidance. 

Across Barclays, policies and statements of intent are in place to ensure consistent governance on a range of issues. For the purposes of the 
Non-Financial Reporting requirements, these include, but are not limited to:

Environmental matters
Policy statement Description

Energy and Climate 
Change statement

Our Energy and Climate Change statement sets out our approach to energy sectors with higher carbon-related 
exposures from extraction or consumption, and/or those with an impact in certain sensitive environments, namely 
thermal coal, Arctic oil and gas, and oil sands. The statement outlines the important role Barclays plays in ensuring 
that the world's energy needs are met, while helping to limit the threat that climate change poses to people and to 
the natural environment.

World Heritage Site 
and Ramsar Wetlands 
statement

We understand that certain industries, and in particular mining, oil and gas, and power, can have negative impacts 
on areas of high biodiversity value including UNESCO World Heritage Sites (WHS) and Ramsar Wetlands (RW). Our 
WHS and RW statement outlines our client due diligence approach to preserving and safeguarding these sites.

Climate Change 
Financial and 
Operational Risk Policy  

In 2019, we published a ‘Climate Change Financial Risk and Operational Risk Policy'. This introduced climate 
change as an overarching risk impacting certain principal risks: credit risk, market risk, treasury and capital risk and 
operational risk. The policy is jointly owned by the relevant Principal Risk Leads with oversight by the Board Risk 
Committee.

Forestry and  
Palm Oil statement

We recognise that the production of timber products and palm oil is often associated with significant environmental 
and social impacts, particularly in relation to biodiversity loss, tropical deforestation and climate change. Our 
Forestry and Palm Oil Statement outlines our due diligence approach for clients involved in these activities, ensuring 
that we support clients that promote sustainable forestry and agribusiness practices whilst respecting the rights of 
workers and local communities.

Colleagues
Policy statement Description

Board Diversity Policy The Board Diversity Policy sets out the approach to diversity on the Boards of Barclays.

Code of Conduct The Barclays Code of Conduct outlines the Values and Behaviours which govern our way of working across 
our business globally. It constitutes a reference point covering all aspects of colleagues' working relationships, 
specifically (but not exclusively) with other Barclays employees, customers and clients, governments and regulators, 
business partners, suppliers, competitors and the broader community.

Health, safety 
and welfare

Our commitment is to ensure the health, safety and welfare of our employees and to provide and maintain safe 
working conditions. Effective management of health and safety will have a positive effect on the services we provide. 

Equality and Diversity 
Charter

Barclays Equality and Diversity Charter governs the approach for employees of the Group. A diverse employee-base 
will include and make good use of differences in the skills, regional and industry experience, background, race, 
gender and other distinctions between employees, with all appointments made on merit.

Human rights

Policy statement Description

Human rights We operate in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and take account of other internationally 
accepted human rights standards. We also promote human rights through our employment policies and practices, 
through our supply chain and through the responsible use of our products and services.

Modern slavery Barclays recognises its responsibility to comply with all relevant legislation including the UK Modern Slavery Act 
2015. In accordance with the requirements of the Act, we release an annual Barclays Group Statement on Modern 
Slavery, which outlines the actions we have taken to address the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking in 
our operations, supply chain, and customer and client relationships. 

Supply chain Our supply base is diverse, including start-ups, small and medium-sized businesses, and businesses owned, 
controlled and operated by under-represented segments of society as well as multinational corporations. We 
recognise that these partnerships have significant direct and indirect environmental and social impacts. We actively 
encourage our supplier partners to meet Barclays' requirements in order to meet our obligations to our stakeholders.

Data protection Across Barclays, the privacy and security of personal information is respected and protected. Our Privacy Statement 
governs how we collect, handle, store, share, use and dispose of information about people. We regard sound privacy 
practices as a key element of corporate governance and accountability.

Anti-bribery and anti-corruption

Policy statement Description

Bribery and corruption We recognise that corruption can undermine the rule of law, democratic processes and basic human freedoms, 
impoverishing states and distorting free trade and competition. Our statement reflects the statutory requirements 
applicable in the UK as derived from the United Nations and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development conventions on corruption.

Anti-money laundering 
and counter-terrorist 
financing

Barclays Anti-Money Laundering Policy is designed to ensure that we comply with the requirements and obligations 
set out in UK legislation, regulations, rules and industry guidance for the financial services sector, including the need 
to have adequate systems and controls in place to mitigate the risk of the bank being used to facilitate financial 
crime.

Social matters
Policy statement Description

Donations Barclays works in partnership with non-profit organisations, including charities and NGOs, to develop high- 
performing programmes and volunteering opportunities that harness the skills and passion of our employees. 
Barclays has chosen to partner with a small number of organisations, allowing us to have deeper relationships 
and ultimately enabling us to have the greatest impact on our communities in which we operate. Barclays does 
not accept unsolicited donation requests.

Tax Our Tax Principles are central to our approach to tax planning, for ourselves or on behalf of our clients. Since their 
introduction in 2013 we believe our Tax Principles have been a strong addition to the way we manage tax, ensuring 
that we take into account all of our stakeholders when making decisions related to our tax affairs. The same applies 
to our Tax Code of Conduct.

Sanctions Sanctions are restrictions on activity with targeted countries, governments, entities, individuals and industries that 
are imposed by bodies such as the United Nations (UN), the European Union (EU), individual countries or groups of 
countries. The Barclays Group Sanctions Policy is designed to ensure that the Group complies with applicable 
sanctions laws in every jurisdiction in which it operates.

The defence industry We provide financial services to the defence sector within a specific policy framework. Each proposal is assessed 
on a case-by-case basis and legal compliance alone does not automatically guarantee our support. The Barclays 
Statement on the Defence Sector outlines our appetite for defence-related transactions and relationships.

 Board of Directors:  
a year of renewal

DIRECTORS' REPORT

2019 has been a year of renewal for 
the Board: a new Chairman, two 
significant Non-Executive Director 
appointments (with a further 
Non-Executive Director appointed 
with effect from February 2020) and 
a smaller Board. We believe that a 
Board with the right balance of skills, 
experience and diversity is critical 
to the sustainable delivery of value 
to our shareholders and we are 
confident that the changes to the 
composition of the Board will help 
us to achieve this.

This has also been a year of significant 
change to the ExCo. We have 
strengthened the ExCo, enhancing 
engagement and oversight and 
driving greater accountability for key 
business areas. We have achieved this 
by appointing to the ExCo the heads 
of our Corporate Bank, our Markets 
business, our Banking business, and 
the new Global Head of Consumer 
Banking and Payments.

48 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2019 home.barclays/annualreport

Barclays is a large, diversified organisation. We are committed, 
through our governance model, to driving four key features: 
simplification, collaboration, accountability and quality of  
decision-making.

Board composition
In 2019, we welcomed our new Chairman, 
Nigel Higgins. We also announced the 
appointment of two new Non-Executive 
Directors:

■■ Dawn Fitzpatrick, who joined the Board 
on 25 September 2019; and 

■■ Mohamed A. El-Erian, who joined the 
Board on 1 January 2020.

In January 2020, we announced the 
appointment of Brian Gilvary who joined 
the Board on 1 February 2020.

All of these appointments bring tremendous 
insight and experience relevant to the markets 
in which we operate. In accordance with the 
recommendation of the Code, Reuben Jeffery 
and Dr. Dambisa Moyo, each having served 
on the Board for nine years, stepped down, 
as did Sir Gerry Grimstone and Mike Turner. 

Our governance framework
Our Group-wide governance framework 
has been designed to facilitate the effective 
management of the Group by our CEO and 
his ExCo whilst preserving the constructive 
challenge, support and oversight of our major 
subsidiary boards in the UK, Ireland and the 
US, consistent with their respective legal and 
regulatory responsibilities. The Barclays PLC 
(BPLC) Board sets the strategic direction and 
risk appetite of the Group and is the ultimate 
decision-making body for matters of 
Group-wide strategic, financial, regulatory 
or reputational significance.

BPLC is the Group parent company and 
has a premium listing on the London Stock 
Exchange. Each of our main operating entities, 
Barclays Bank PLC (BBPLC), Barclays Bank UK 
PLC (BBUKPLC), Barclays Bank Ireland PLC, 
Barclays US LLC and Barclays Bank Delaware, 
has its own board comprising Executive and 

Non-Executive Directors. Each also has 
its own board committees.

During the year, we consolidated and 
streamlined membership of the BPLC and 
BBPLC Boards, such that membership of the 
BBPLC Board is now a subset of the BPLC 
Board, with all members of the BPLC Board 
except the Senior Independent Director (SID), 
the Chairman of BBUKPLC and one Non-
Executive Director now also serving on the 
board of BBPLC. This partial consolidation 
has significantly increased coordination 
and efficiency, and reduced complexity 
and duplication. The revised BBPLC Board 
composition vests oversight over the activities 
of BBPLC in a board the members of which 
also have direct accountability to BPLC's 
shareholders through their separate 
responsibilities as members of the 
BPLC Board.

Striving for simplicity  
and effectiveness

Matthew Lester stepped down on 1 January 
2020. We also bade farewell to John McFarlane, 
who stepped down after four years as 
Chairman, including a period where he was 
Executive Chairman. We are grateful to them 
all for their service to Barclays.

We are actively seeking to complement the 
current range of skills on our Board, ideally 
with individuals who can bring additional 
retail banking and technology experience. 
Our strong belief in the benefits of diversity – 
of gender, ethnicity and thought – underpins 
our search. In the report of our Nominations 
Committee we address the continuing 
evolution of our Board.

Principal committees  
The principal committees of the Board, and 
the core responsibilities of each, are described 
in the ‘Board Governance Framework' table at 
the foot of the previous page. The remit of each 
committee is set out in brief in the table, and 
you can read more about the committees and 
their work on pages 52 to 73 and 121 to 123. 

In September 2019, the Board reviewed the 
responsibilities of the Reputation Committee 
and reallocated them mainly to the Board so 
that it could itself directly oversee the critical 
topics of culture, the environment and 
reputation. Responsibility for the oversight of 
Conduct risk and Compliance was transferred 
from the Reputation Committee to the 
Risk Committee.

We measure our effectiveness
An effective Board is one that delivers for 
stakeholders. We assess the effectiveness 
of our Board, its committees and Board 
members each year, as required by the Code. 
Although the Code only requires an externally 
facilitated evaluation every three years, for 
each of the past four years we have used the 
services of an external agency to facilitate the 
assessment of the effectiveness of the Board. 
This year, the Nominations Committee 
decided to ask our Senior Independent 
Director (SID), with the support of the 
Company Secretary, to conduct the 
assessment. They are well placed to do this, 
having been closely involved in the transition 
to a new Chairman and the evolving 
composition of the Board and the way it 
operates. You can read more about our 2019 
process and our progress against the 2018 
review on pages 64 to 65.

Governance in action: our 
programme of prioritised 
deep dives 
To underpin informed and sound decision-
making, the Board needs to have a deep 
and granular understanding of the Group 
as a whole and each of its significant 
businesses – where the key risks lie, 
how and where resources are allocated 
and the contribution made by each part 
of the business. 

Led by the Chairman, the Board and the ExCo 
have agreed a prioritised series of deep dives 
which now form a significant part of each 
Board meeting, with two to four deep dives 
on the agenda for a typical Board meeting. 
The materials for each deep dive facilitate 
an in-depth understanding of the issues 
and generate meaningful discussion, debate, 
support to management and challenge on 
key topics, allowing the Board to exercise 
effective oversight and assist the delivery 
of the Group's strategy. 

Through this process, the Board considers 
strategy at every meeting, rather than in 
a set piece event once a year. 

The Board has discharged its responsibilities 
as described in this high-level flow diagram.

We think of governance as how we govern the organisation 
and make decisions to promote its success for the long-term 
benefit of our stakeholders. Effective governance makes 
possible the delivery of our purpose and our strategy.

Key priorities

Core areas of focus
Our programme of deep dives is outlined 
below and in the ‘Governance in action' 
section on the previous page. This programme 
commenced in July 2019, following the 
appointment of Nigel Higgins as Chairman. 
The deep dives held this year included 
consideration of a wide range of topics, 
covering selected individual business units 
as well as Group-wide matters such as our 
capital allocation framework, our costs, our 
societal purpose, our culture, the environment 
and our risk profile.

Feedback from our shareholders and wider 
stakeholders has been taken into account 
in arriving at and prioritising our deep dives. 

The Board received updates on the 
performance of the business and execution 
of the strategy at every meeting, and the 
approval of our MTP, in which our strategy 
is embedded, was a key Board responsibility 
at its November and December 2019 
meetings. We also gave considerable focus to 
developments in the regulatory environment, 
and to engagement with our regulators in the 
UK and the US in particular. The oversight of 
risk and of our control environment is also 
a core Board responsibility and has been 
addressed at meetings through the year.   

Stakeholder engagement
We have enjoyed extensive engagement with 
our shareholders in 2019 through a variety 
of mechanisms, including:

■■ in February, March and April 2019, 
Nigel Higgins held around 50 meetings 
with shareholders and other stakeholders. 
This was a ‘listening tour', the aim of 
which was for Nigel to introduce himself 
to a wide range of stakeholders, including 
our institutional shareholders, and to 
hear directly from them their views on the 
Group before he became Chairman in 
May 2019. We also engaged with activist 
investor Sherborne Investors Management 
LP as part of this process

■■ our AGM, where the Board engaged 
extensively with shareholders, both 
formally during the meeting and 
informally before and after the AGM 

■■ through our intensive Investor Relations 
programme of conference calls, webcasts 
and meetings at the time of each of our 
quarterly results releases.

Our broader stakeholder engagement is 
described in the Strategic report. Specifically 
with regard to our workforce, engagement 
with our colleagues has long been a part 
of our DNA as an organisation. The Board 
conducted a full review of our existing 
engagement model and concluded that this, 
with certain enhancements, would be the best 
and most effective means to ensure sustained 
engagement with our workforce whilst also 
meeting the objectives of the Code's new 
workforce engagement requirements. Our 
workforce engagement model is described 
in the People section on page 28 to 31. 

Purpose, culture and values
Our purpose, adopted in May 2018, is 
‘Creating opportunities to rise'. This is 
underpinned by our values: respect, integrity, 
service, excellence and stewardship, and by 
the behaviours associated with them. Our 
purpose, values and behaviours are designed 
to support each other, to drive our culture and 
to guide our strategy and decision-making. 

The Board has recently examined our purpose 
and concluded that whilst it is fully integrated 
into many of our key processes and decision-
making forums, we have further work to do 
to bring to life: to express and apply it 
consistently across the Group, and for it 
to better connect all of our stakeholders, 
our businesses, ESG activities and ambitions. 
This work is under way.

Our values were adopted in January 2013. 
They were, and remain, fully embedded and 
integrated into the Group.

Our culture is a core area of focus for the 
Board, which believes that the right culture 
and values, supported by effective leadership 
and a consistent tone from the top, are crucial 
to the success of the Group.

How does the Board review 
our culture?
The Board reviews our culture in a number 
of ways, including:

■■ quantitative and qualitative feedback on 
how our culture aligns with our purpose, 
values and strategy through Culture 
Dashboards, so the Board can see the 
effect our people engagement has on our 
performance, and the continued strength 
of our culture

■■ analysis of employee survey results
■■ face-to-face engagement with employees 

locally to hear what they think
■■ review of people policies, which are 

designed to provide equal opportunities 
and create an inclusive culture, in line 
with our values and in support of our 
long-term success.

The Board believes 
the right culture and 
values, supported by 
effective leadership 
and a consistent 
tone from the top, 
are crucial to the 
success of the Group.

52 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2019 home.barclays/annualreport

Dear Fellow Shareholders
2019 was a year of steady progress for 
the Group both in enhancing its control 
environment and embedding new financial 
reporting requirements, particularly in relation to 
the expected credit loss (ECL) model introduced 
by the implementation of IFRS 9 in 2018.

Ensuring focus on strengthening the Barclays' 
internal control environment has continued 
to be a key activity for the Committee. 2019 
was an important year for the Barclays Internal 
Control Environment Programme (BICEP) 
which commenced in January 2017 and is on 
track to complete by the end of March 2020. 
As at the end of 2019, 94% of issues were 
either closed or in validation with 96% of the 
BICEP milestones achieved. When BICEP is fully 
completed, the Group's control environment 
will be in a much stronger position, but 
inevitably, as expectations and standards 
change and new control events occur, work is 
still required both to maintain and to further 
develop it. The Committee is therefore working 
to ensure that as we transition to ‘business as 
usual', management has a robust framework 
for identifying and responding to control issues 
with appropriate reporting to the Committee 
and other Board Committees. A key component 
of this will be the work the Chief Controls Office 
is doing to further streamline and automate 
the Risk and Controls Self-Assessment (RCSA) 
process to make it more dynamic.

In assessing general control issues for 
disclosure in this Annual Report, the 
Committee continued to apply similar 
concepts to those used for assessing internal 
financial controls for the purposes of the US 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX). The conclusion we 
reached is that there are no control issues that 
are considered to be a material weakness and 
which therefore merit specific disclosure.

IFRS 9 continued to be a major focus for the 
Committee this year as models continue to be 
validated and refined. In addition, disclosures 
have been enhanced, although more work is 
required to develop the ability to generate and 
disclose more meaningful sensitivity analyses. 
Following the introduction of the time bar 
by the FCA at the end of August, the level 
of subjectivity of the PPI provision at 
31 December 2019 has been considerably 
reduced. However the Committee did consider 
whether the ‘spike' in complaints received 
just before the deadline might have been 
anticipated and was satisfied that there was 

The Board Audit Committee has a central role 
in maintaining and challenging the quality of Barclays' 
external disclosures and its internal control environment. 

Ensuring reporting integrity and 
an effective controls environment

DIRECTORS' REPORT: BOARD AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT

no evidence that would have justified an 
earlier significant increase in the provision.

I continued my regular meetings with the 
Chairs of the main subsidiary audit committees, 
including the Chair of the BBPLC audit 
committee until the consolidation of the BPLC 
and BBPLC boards. Since that time I have also 
met with the Chair of the Barclays US LLC audit 
committee, attended a meeting of the Barclays 
Bank Ireland PLC audit committee, and 
attended the meeting of the BBUKPLC audit 
committee which considered the main year-end 
accounting issues. The Chair of the BBUKPLC 
audit committee also attends the meeting of 
the Committee where we consider the control 
environment of BBUKPLC as part of our 
year-end evaluation. I also continued to 
meet frequently with members of senior 
management, including the Group Finance 
Director and Chief Internal Auditor. In relation 
to the latter, I am pleased that the Committee 
approved the appointment in September 2019 
of Lindsay O'Reilly as the new Chief Internal 
Auditor following a joint recommendation from 
myself and the Group Chief Executive Officer. As 
she was appointed to this role from a first line 
of defence function, the Committee have taken 
steps to understand and safeguard against 
potential and perceived conflicts of interest that 
may arise in order to support BIA's continued 
independence from the business. BIA is a key 
component in supporting the Committee's 
work and I am pleased with the way that the 
function has continued to develop throughout 
the year in scoping, performing and reporting 
the outcomes of its work both to management 
and the Committee.

I have also continued my regular engagement 
with the Group's regulators both in the UK and 
US. This has encompassed not only my work 
as the Chair of the Committee, but also my role 
as the Group's Whistleblowing Champion. In 
that respect, I also oversaw the production of 
the first of three annual reports which we have 
agreed to submit to the FCA and PRA in the UK 
and also the New York Department of Financial 
Services containing certain information 
regarding our whistleblowing programme. 

Committee performance
The performance of the Committee was 
assessed internally as part of the annual 
effectiveness review of the Board. In line 
with the approach adopted for all Board 
Committees in 2019, the process involved 

completion of a tailored questionnaire by 
Committee members and standing attendees. 

The results confirm that the Committee is 
operating effectively, and the Board takes a 
high level of assurance from the technical 
and commercial competence and diligence 
of the Committee's work. It is considered 
well-constituted, with the right balance of skills 
and experience to provide an appropriately 
broad level of challenge and oversight of the 
areas within its remit. Consideration will need 
to be given to adding an additional member 
of the Committee with recent and relevant 
financial experience following the departure 
of Matthew Lester at the end of the year.

Last year's review commented on the 
improved focus of the Committee on key 
issues in the context of managing a 
demanding agenda efficiently so that time 
is allocated to the most significant items 
for discussion. As the Committee has taken 
on additional responsibilities during the year, 
for example the oversight of tax matters, 
continued focus on this area will be beneficial.

In response to a request to provide feedback 
on the interaction with subsidiary audit 
committees, the review highlighted that 
interaction with the BBUKPLC audit committee 
had been helpful and effective. Following 
the consolidation of the membership of the 
Committee with the BBPLC audit committee, 
coverage of BBPLC matters within concurrent 
meetings was considered adequate, noting 
that it will benefit from further embedment.

Looking ahead
In 2020, the Committee will still continue to 
monitor the embedment of IFRS 9 processes 
and further enhancements to our disclosure, 
particularly as regards sensitivities. 

We will also be looking to assess the reporting 
of control issues after the conclusion of BICEP 
as well as monitor the satisfactory completion 
of remediation programmes which are due to 
extend beyond 31 March 2020, in particular the 
Designated Markets Activity remediation plan.

Committee composition 
and meetings
The Committee is composed solely of 
independent Non-Executive Directors, 
with membership designed to provide the 
breadth of financial expertise and commercial 
acumen it needs to fulfil its responsibilities. 
Its members as a whole have recent and 
relevant experience of the banking and 
financial services sector, in addition to general 
management and commercial experience, 
and are financially literate. In particular, 
Mike Ashley, who is the designated financial 
expert on the Committee for the purposes of 
SOX is a former audit partner who, during his 
executive career, acted as lead engagement 
partner on the audits of a number of large 
financial services groups. Matthew Lester, 
who resigned from the Committee on 
1 January 2020, held a number of senior 
finance roles across a range of business 
sectors, including financial services, during 
his executive career. You can find more details 
of the experience of Committee members 
in their biographies on pages 44 to 46.

During 2019, the Committee met 10 times and 
the chart opposite shows how it allocated its 
time. Attendance by members at Committee 
meetings is also shown opposite. Committee 
meetings were attended by representatives 
from management, including the Group Chief 
Executive Officer, Group Finance Director, 
Chief Internal Auditor, Chief Controls Officer, 
Chief Risk Officer, Chief Operating Officer, 
Group General Counsel and Group Chief 
Compliance Officer, as well as representatives 
from the businesses and other functions. 
The lead audit engagement partner of KPMG, 
Michelle Hinchliffe, also attended Committee 
meetings. The Committee held a number 
of separate private sessions with each of 
the Chief Internal Auditor and the lead audit 
engagement partner, which were not attended 
by management.

Ensuring reporting integrity and 
an effective controls environment

DIRECTORS' REPORT: BOARD AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT

Area of focus Reporting issue Role of the Committee Conclusion/action taken

Fair, balanced and 
understandable 
reporting
(including Country-
by-Country Reporting 
and Modern Slavery 
Statement)

In light of the Board's obligation 
under the Code, the Committee 
assesses external reporting 
to ensure it is fair, balanced 
and understandable.

In addition to this Annual Report 
and associated year-end reports, 
the Committee also reviewed the 
Group's quarterly reports and the 
GFD's presentations to analysts. 

The Committee informed these 
reviews by:

■■ consideration of reports of the 
Disclosure Committee which 
included views on content, 
accuracy and tone

■■ direct questioning of 
management including the CEO 
and GFD on the transparency 
and accuracy of disclosures

■■ consideration of management's 
response to letters issued by 
the FRC

■■ evaluation of the output of the 
Group's internal control 
assessments and SOX s404 
internal control process

■■ consideration of the results of 
management's processes relating 
to financial reporting matters and 
to evidence the representations 
provided to the external auditors.

The Committee noted specifically that 
whilst the disclosures regarding IFRS 9 
met nearly all the recommendations 
from the Enhanced Disclosure Task 
Force these were still evolving. 
The Committee encouraged 
management to continue to 
enhance the disclosure particularly 
as the ability to analyse sensitivities 
was developed.

Having evaluated all of the available 
information, the assurances by 
management and underlying 
processes used to prepare the 
published financial information, 
the Committee concluded and advised 
the Board that the 2019 Annual Report 
and financial statements are fair 
balanced and understandable.

Going concern and 
long-term viability 
(refer to the Viability 
Statement on pages 
39 and 40)

Barclays is required to assess 
whether it is appropriate to 
prepare the financial statements 
on a going concern basis and also, 
in accordance with the Code, 
Barclays must provide a statement 
of its viability.

The Committee considered both 
the going concern assumption and 
the form and content of the Viability 
Statement having regard to:

■■ the MTP and WCR
■■ the forecasted liquidity and 

funding profile
■■ the results of stress tests based 

on both internal and regulatory 
specified assumptions as 
reviewed by the Risk Committee

■■ current risk and strategy 
disclosures.

The Committee recommended to the 
Board that the financial statements 
should be prepared on a going concern 
basis and that there were no material 
uncertainties that may cast significant 
doubt on the Group's ability to 
continue as a going concern.

The Committee also agreed that 
the appropriate time frame for the 
viability statement continued to be 
three years and recommended the 
viability statement to the Board 
for approval.

Area of focus Reporting issue Role of the Committee Conclusion/action taken

Impairment
(refer to Note 7 to the 
financial statements)

Following implementation of 
IFRS 9, ECLs are modelled using 
a range of forecast economic 
scenarios. The key areas of 
judgement include setting the 
modelling assumptions, developing 
the macroeconomic scenarios and 
the methodology for weighting 
them, establishing the criteria to 
determine significant deterioration 
in credit quality and the application 
of management adjustments to 
the modelled output. 

As part of their monitoring the 
Committee considered a number 
of reports from management on:

■■ the continued development 
and embedding of controls over 
the internal processes supporting 
the ECL calculation and related 
assessment of SOX compliance 
(including by the external 
auditors)

■■ model changes and refinements 
to the staging criteria

■■ regeneration of the 
macroeconomic variables 
and associated weighting

■■ adjustments made to the 
modelled output to reflect 
updated data and known 
model deficiencies

■■ comparisons between actual 
experience and forecast losses

■■ single name exposures.

Having considered and scrutinised 
the reports, the Committee agreed 
with management's conclusion that 
the impairment provision (including 
specifically the £150m for anticipated 
economic uncertainty in the UK) 
was appropriate. 

Going forward, the Committee 
also agreed with management that 
it would be appropriate to review 
the frequency of regenerating the 
macroeconomic scenarios.

Conduct provisions
(refer to Note 24 to the 
financial statements)

Barclays makes certain 
assumptions and estimates, 
analysis of which underpins 
provisions made for the costs of 
customer redress, such as for PPI.

With a view to evaluating adequacy 
of the provision, the Committee 
analysed the judgements and 
estimates made with regard to 
Barclays' provisioning for PPI claims, 
taking into account: 

■■ forecasts and assumptions made 
for PPI complaints

■■ actual claims levels and validity 
of claims

■■ increased levels of claims based 
on the August 2019 time bar 
for claims (including claims from 
the Official Receiver).

In light of information received, the 
Committee agreed with management 
that the PPI provision was adequate 
during H1 2019 and did not need to 
be increased. The PPI provision was 
increased in Q3 2019 by £1.4bn due 
to the exceptionally high volume of 
claims received in late August 2019 
prior to the time bar. The Committee 
agreed with this increase and that the 
level of provision at the end of the year 
was appropriate.

The Committee also made 
recommendations regarding the 
sensitivity disclosures.

Legal, competition 
and regulatory 
provisions
(refer to Notes 24  
and 26 to the 
financial statements)

Barclays is engaged in various legal, 
competition and regulatory matters 
which may give rise to provisioning 
based on the facts. 

The level of provisioning is subject 
to management judgement on 
the basis of legal advice and is, 
therefore, an area of focus for 
the Committee.

Evaluated advice on the status 
of current legal, competition and 
regulatory matters and assessed 
management's judgements on 
the levels of provisions to be taken 
and accompanying disclosure.

The Committee discussed provisions 
and utilisation and having reviewed 
the information available to determine 
what was both probable and could 
be reliably estimated, the Committee 
agreed that the level of provision 
at the year-end was appropriate. 
The Committee also considered that 
the disclosures made provided the 
appropriate information for investors 
regarding the legal, competition and 
regulatory matters being addressed 
by the Group.

DIRECTORS' REPORT: BOARD AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT

Area of focus Reporting issue Role of the Committee Conclusion/action taken

Valuations
(refer to Notes  
13 to 17 to the 
financial statements)

Barclays exercises judgement in 
the valuation and disclosure of 
financial instruments, derivative 
assets and certain portfolios, 
particularly where quoted market 
prices are not available.

The Committee:

■■ evaluated reports from the Group 
Financial Controller

■■ monitored the valuation methods 
applied by management requiring 
significant judgement such as the 
ESHLA portfolio

■■ reviewed the restructuring of the 
long-dated derivative portfolio 
which had previously given rise 
to a significant valuation disparity 
with the counterparty.

The Committee noted that there 
were no new significant valuation 
judgements at the end of the year.

The Committee was satisfied with the 
accounting treatment on an amortised 
cost basis of the investments now 
held as a result of the restructuring 
of the long-dated derivative portfolio. 
The Committee was also satisfied 
that the day one valuation ascribed 
to resultant instruments was 
appropriate by reference both to 
the existing valuation methodology 
and the ongoing profitability of the 
instruments now held.

Tax
(refer to Note 9 to the 
financial statements)

Barclays is subject to taxation in a 
number of jurisdictions globally and 
makes judgements with regard to 
provisioning for tax at risk, and on 
the recognition and measurement 
of deferred tax assets.

The Committee is responsible 
for considering the Group's tax 
strategy and overseeing compliance 
with the Group's Tax Code of 
Conduct. In this regard the 
Committee received reports from 
the Tax Management Oversight 
Committee and in particular 
considered the utilisation of the 
Luxembourg tax losses and revised 
US holding company structure.

The Committee reviewed the 
appropriateness of provisions 
made for uncertain tax positions, 
including the retrospective 
de-grouping of certain entities 
from the UK VAT group.

The Committee also confirmed 
that the estimates and assumptions 
used in assessing the recoverability 
of deferred tax assets were supported 
by the MTP.

The Committee was satisfied that 
specific strategies were in line with the 
Group's Tax Code of Conduct and on 
behalf of the Board approved the UK 
Tax Strategy statement published as 
part of the Country-by-Country Report. 

The Committee noted that the 
uncertain tax positions covered 
a diverse range of issues and as 
a consequence agreed with 
management's view that there was 
not a significant risk of a material 
adjustment during the next year.

The Committee was also satisfied 
that deferred tax assets recognition 
was appropriate.

and risk management 
processes on pages 78 
to 79.

The effectiveness of the overall 
control environment, including 
the status of any significant 
control issues and the progress 
of specific remediation plans.

The Committee:

■■ evaluated and tracked the status 
of the most significant control 
issues through regular reports 
from the Chief Controls Officer, 
including updates on lessons 
learned and assessment against 
the Controls Maturity Model. 
The Committee also received 
independent evaluations from 
BIA and external auditors

■■ evaluated the status of specific 
significant control Hot Spots, 
specifically; transaction 
operations, cyber, treasury and 
capital liquidity risk reporting and 
model risk (control framework 
and model reporting)

■■ scrutinised reports from individual 
businesses and functions on their 
control environment and focused 
on the progress relating to 
remediation areas

■■ monitored CASS updates and 
associated remediation activities.

At its next meeting, the Committee 
will receive feedback from the Chief 
Controls Office on the 2019 RCSA 
process, which will help inform the 
Committee's overall assessment of 
the Group's control environment. 
The Committee also received 
preliminary feedback from the Chief 
Controls Officer on the 2019 RCSA 
process which helped inform the 
Committee's overall assessment of 
the Group's control environment. 

Throughout 2019, the Committee has:

■■ monitored progress of BICEP 
against completion. At the end of 
2019, the Committee noted that 
BICEP was on target for completion 
by March 2020

■■ monitored key control issues 
through a series of deep dives and 
scrutinised the pathway to ‘Return 
to Satisfactory' in respect of 
internal controls operated by the 
various functions and businesses 

■■ recommended enhancements to 
the RCSA review process, including 
streamlining review through 
integration with the internal control 
process review

■■ enhanced monitoring of liquidity 
risk remediation actions relating 
to buffer increases, following an 
increase in regulatory technical 
breaches.

Raising concerns The adequacy of the Group's 
arrangements to allow employees 
to raise concerns in confidence 
and anonymously without fear 
of retaliation, and the outcomes 
of any substantiated cases.

The Committee:

■■ has overseen the embedding 
of a new centralised team 
to manage concerns raised 

■■ received reports from 
management and monitored 
whistleblowing metrics and 
retaliation reports.

The Committee received two in-depth 
semi-annual reports on whistleblowing 
from management. At year end the 
Committee noted the recent 
‘Satisfactory' rating by BIA of the audit 
of the centralised team and considered 
that the whistleblowing programme 
generally met with best practice as 
identified by the PRA. However the 
Committee encouraged the team 
to consider how interaction with 
whistleblowers might be further 
enhanced to improve their experience 
with the process. In addition the 
Committee stressed the importance of 
ensuring the time taken to investigate 
concerns robustly was as short as 
possible in order to minimise the 
potential stress for all concerned.

External auditor
Following an external audit tender in 2015, 
KPMG was appointed as Barclays' statutory 
auditor with effect from the 2017 financial 
year. Michelle Hinchliffe of KPMG is the Senior 
Statutory Auditor and was appointed to this 
role with effect from the 2018 financial year.

Assessing external auditor 
effectiveness, objectivity 
and independence and  
non-audit services
The Committee is responsible for assessing the 
effectiveness, objectivity and independence of 
the Group's auditor, KPMG. This responsibility 
was discharged throughout the year at formal 
Committee meetings, during private meetings 
with KPMG, and through discussions with 
key executive stakeholders. In addition to the 
matters noted above, the Committee also:

■■ approved the terms of the audit 
engagement letter and associated fees, 
on behalf of the Board

■■ discussed and agreed revisions to the 
Group policy on the Provision of Services 
by the Group Statutory Auditor (the Policy) 
and regularly analysed reports from 
management on the non-audit services 
provided to Barclays

■■ evaluated and approved revisions to the 
Group policy on Employment of Employees 
or Workers from the Statutory Auditor 
and ensured compliance with the policy 
by regularly assessing reports from 
management detailing any 
appointments made

■■ was briefed by KPMG on critical 
accounting judgements and estimates and 
internal controls over financial reporting

■■ considered the formal report from the 
Public Company Audit Oversight Board on 
their review of KPMG's audit of the 2017 
financial statements and the consequential 
revisions made by KPMG to their audits 
for both the 2018 and 2019 financial 
statements. These were in line with the 
provisional results reported last year 

■■ assessed any potential threats to 
independence that were self-identified 
and reported by KPMG.

The Committee is aware that the FRC has 
also reviewed certain aspects of KPMG's audit 
of the 2018 financial statements although its 
report is not yet available. KPMG has informed 
the Committee of areas for improvement 
which are likely to be reported by the FRC 
and how these matters have been addressed 
in the 2019 audit. Based on its understanding 
to date, the Committee believes that KPMG's 
audit work should provide reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements 
are free of material misstatement.

KPMG's performance, independence and 
objectivity during 2019 were also formally 
assessed at the beginning of 2020 by way 
of a questionnaire completed by key 
stakeholders across the Group, including the 
chairs of the BBUKPLC, Barclays US LLC and 
Barclays Bank Ireland PLC audit committees. 
The questionnaire was designed to evaluate 
KPMG's audit process and addressed 
matters such as the quality of planning and 
communication, technical knowledge, the 
level of scrutiny and challenge applied and 
KPMG's understanding of the business. In 
addition, as in the prior year, KPMG nominated 
a senior partner of the audit team reporting to 
the Senior Statutory Auditor to have specific 
responsibility for ensuring audit quality. The 
Committee therefore met with the partner 
concerned without the Senior Statutory 
Auditor to receive a report on their 
assessment of audit quality. 

Taking into account the result of all of the 
above, the Committee considered that KPMG 
maintained its independence and objectivity 
and that the audit process was effective. 

Non-audit services
In order to safeguard the auditor's 
independence and objectivity, Barclays has in 
place a policy setting out the circumstances in 
which the auditor may be engaged to provide 
services other than those covered by the 
Group audit. The Policy applies to all Barclays' 
subsidiaries and other material entities over 
which Barclays has significant influence. The 

core principle of the Policy is that non-audit 
services (other than those legally required to 
be carried out by the Group's auditor) should 
only be performed by the auditor in certain 
controlled circumstances. The Policy sets 
out those types of services that are strictly 
prohibited and those that are allowable in 
principle. Any service types that do not fall 
within either list are considered by the 
Committee Chair on a case-by-case basis, 
supported by a risk assessment provided by 
management. A summary of the Policy can 
be found at home.barclays/who-we-are/
our-governance/auditor-independence

The Policy is reviewed on an annual basis 
to ensure that it is fit for purpose, and that 
it reflects applicable rules and guidelines. 

The Policy is also aligned with KPMG's own 
internal policy on non-audit services for 
FTSE 350 companies which broadly restricts 
non-audit work to services that are ‘closely 
related' to the audit.

Any changes to the Policy are approved at 
a Group level by the Committee. This is in 
accordance with European Union law and 
FRC guidance, pursuant to which audit 
committees of Public Interest Entities (such 
as Barclays) are required to approve non-audit 
services provided by their auditors to such 
entities, and subsidiary Public Interest Entities 
in the UK – such as BBUKPLC and BBPLC – 
can rely on the approval of non-audit services 
by the ultimate parent's audit committee. 
It should be noted that audit services, and the 
fee cap, will also be monitored by the relevant 
audit committee, as appropriate.

Under the Policy, the Committee has 
pre-approved all allowable services for which 
fees are less than £100,000. However, all 
proposed work, regardless of the fees, must 
be sponsored by a senior executive and 
recorded on a centralised online system, with 
a detailed explanation of the clear commercial 
benefit arising from engaging the auditor over 
other potential service providers. The audit 
engagement partner must also confirm that 
the engagement has been approved in 
accordance with the auditor's own internal 
ethical standards and does not pose any 
threat to the auditor's independence or 
objectivity. All requests to engage the auditor 
are assessed by independent management 
before work can commence. Requests for 
allowable service types in respect of which the 
fees are expected to meet or exceed the above 
threshold must be approved by the Chair of 
the Committee before work is permitted to 
begin. Services where the fees are expected 
to be £250,000 or higher must be approved 
by the Committee as a whole. All expenses 
and disbursements must be included in the 
fees calculation.

The Committee 
considered that 
KPMG maintained its 
independence and 
objectivity, and that 
the audit process 
was effective.

https://home.barclays/investor-relations/reports-and-events/annual-reports/
<Page End><Page Start>
60 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2019 home.barclays/annualreport

During 2019, all engagements where expected 
fees met or exceeded the above threshold 
were evaluated by either the Committee Chair 
or the Committee as a whole who, before 
confirming any approval, assured themselves 
that there was justifiable reason for engaging 
the auditor and that its independence 
and objectivity would not be threatened. 
No requests to use KPMG were declined  
by the Committee in 2019 (2018: none). 
On a quarterly basis, the Committee reviewed 
details of individually approved and 
pre-approved services undertaken by KPMG 
in order to satisfy itself that they posed no risk 
to independence, either in isolation or on an 
aggregated basis.

For the purposes of the Policy, the Committee 
has determined that any pre-approved service 
of a value of under £50,000 is to be regarded 
as trivial in terms of its impact on Barclays' 
financial statements and requires the Group 
Financial Controller to specifically review 
and confirm to the Committee that 
any pre-approved service with a value of 
£50,000-£100,000 may be regarded as such. 
The Committee undertook a review of 
pre-approved services at its meeting in 
December 2019 and satisfied itself that such 
pre-approved services were trivial in the 
context of their impact on the financial 
statements.

The fees payable to KPMG for the year ended 
31 December 2019 amounted to £56m, of 
which £11m (2018: £11m) was payable in 
respect of non-audit services. A breakdown 
of the fees payable to the auditor for statutory 
audit and non-audit work can be found in 
Note 40. Of the £11m of non-audit services 
provided by KPMG during 2019, the significant 
categories of engagement, i.e. services where 
the fees amounted to more than £500,000, 
included:

■■ audit-related services: services 
in connection with CASS audits

■■ other services in connection with 
regulatory, compliance and internal control 
reports and audit procedures, required by 
law or regulation to be provided by the 
statutory auditor

■■ other attest and assurance services, 
such as ongoing attestation and assurance 
services for treasury and capital markets 
transactions to meet regulatory 
requirements, including regular reporting 
obligations and verification reports.

The Statutory Audit Services 
for Large Companies Market 
Investigation (Mandatory Use 
of Competitive Tender 
Processes and Audit Committee 
Responsibilities) Order 2014

An external audit tender was conducted in 
2015 and the decision was made to appoint 
KPMG as Barclays' external auditor with 
effect from the 2017 financial year, with PwC 
resigning as the Group's statutory auditor 
at the conclusion of the 2016 audit.

Barclays is in compliance with the 
requirements of The Statutory Audit Services 
for Large Companies Market Investigation 
(Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender 
Processes and Audit Committee 
Responsibilities) Order 2014, which relates 
to the frequency and governance of tenders 
for the appointment of the external auditor 
and the setting of a policy on the provision 
of non-audit services.

Provided that KPMG continue to maintain 
their independence and objectivity, and 
the Committee remains satisfied with their 
performance, the Group has no intention 
of appointing an alternative external auditor 
before the end of the current required period 
of 10 years.

Achieving this – through its focus on the 
composition of the Board, its Committees 
and the ExCo, and by ensuring a pipeline 
of succession to these and other senior 
management key roles – is the main role 
of the Nominations Committee.

Delivering effectiveness is not however just 
about the continuous task of evolving the 
composition of the Board, a Committee or 
the ExCo to ensure that each is diverse and 
well balanced with the right mix of talent, 
skills and experience (illustrated below). 
As important is how the Board operates – 
the quality of its agenda and its engagement 
with management, of the papers and 
presentations it considers and of the rigour 

of its discussions. The effectiveness of 
the Board was enhanced in 2019 through 
revisions to the Board engagement process 
with an intensive focus on the preparation 
of our Board papers, the delivery of targeted 
training sessions to the Board and our 
new programme of prioritised deep dives 
discussed on page 51. 

Much was done in 2019 on all of these fronts, 
and there is more to do. 

The Committee comprises solely 
Non-Executive Directors and is chaired by 
our Group Chairman. Details on Committee 
membership and attendance are set out 
on this page.

Principal activities
The Committee's allocation of time and 
the principal activities during the year 
under review are set out on pages 61 to 63.

Board composition
With the restructuring of Barclays largely 
complete, and a new Chairman in place, 
the Nominations Committee recognised that 
balancing the existing skills on the Board with 
further banking and technology experience 
would enhance its ability to provide informed 
and constructive challenge to management, 
and therefore its effectiveness. 

Building on the work of the Committee 
under previous Chairman John McFarlane, 
the Committee analysed the skills and 
experience on the Board against those 
required to drive forward the execution of 
the Group's strategy and the performance of 
the business. The Committee concluded that 
the Board must now include more Directors 
with experience in technology, retail banking 
and wholesale banking. Capturing the clear 
benefits of greater diversity of background 
and opinion was also recognised as a top 
priority. The Committee also concluded that 
to be more effective the Board would need 
to be smaller. 

Working alongside independent external 
search firms Egon Zehnder and Spencer 
Stuart, neither of which has any connection 
to Barclays or any of the Directors other 
than to assist with searches for executive 
and non-executive talent, the Committee set 
rigorous criteria for the roles it was seeking 
to fill, both in terms of technical capabilities 
and cultural/style attributes, and conducted 
extensive search and selection processes. 
Open advertising for Board positions was 
not used this year.

The Board was delighted to announce the 
appointment in September 2019 of two new 
Non-Executive Directors, Dawn Fitzpatrick 
and Mohamed A. El-Erian, and is confident 
that each will make a very significant 
contribution to the effectiveness of the Board. 
Their respective skills and experience are 
set out in their biographies on page 45. 
Since the year-end, the Board has 
announced the appointment of Brian Gilvary. 
The Committee's focus now is on securing 
a further Non-Executive Director with 
outstanding retail banking and technology 
experience to join the Board, with the benefits 
of diversity remaining a key consideration. 

The Committee has also made progress 
against its goal of delivering a smaller Board 
– a reduction in membership during 2019 from 
15 to 11, going up to 12 with the appointment 
of Dawn Fitzpatrick. On 1 January 2020, 
Mohamed A. El-Erian joined the Board and 
Matthew Lester stepped down, as announced 
on 16 December 2019. Brian Gilvary joined 
the Board on 1 February 2020.

Executive succession
Executive succession is a key consideration 
and during the year, the Committee closely 
monitored the status and progress of Barclays' 
strategies for attracting and retaining the 
best talent.

The Committee played an important role 
in the management changes at ExCo level 
which took place in March 2019. It recognised 
the significant strategic and operational 
benefits of:

■■ elevating to the ExCo the heads of key 
businesses within the CIB

■■ aligning the Group's global consumer 
banking and payments business under 
a newly created ExCo role of Global Head 
of Consumer Banking and Payments. 

You can read more about these and the other 
management changes on page 47. 

Simplification of governance
The Board is already a little smaller than it 
was, and with the support of our regulators 
we have simplified the multi-tier structure 
at the top of the organisation by bringing 
about a much greater overlap between the 
Board and the board of BBPLC. We expect 
this to produce more cohesive and efficient 
governance, and to enhance oversight by, 
and accountability to, the Board for this key 
part of our business.

Diversity
At the end of 2019 we had met our 2020 
Board gender diversity target of 33%. 
Although recent appointments took us to 
31% we are committed to continuing to bring 
the very best, diverse talent we can attract 
to the Board. 

Alongside the Board, the Committee 
continues to champion the benefits of 
diversity – be it religious, ethnic or gender 
diversity or diversity of social backgrounds or 
cognitive and personal strengths – at Board, 
Committee and senior management level. 
In pursuit of this, the Committee is monitoring 
and supporting the Group's focus on 
accelerated development of the female talent 
pipeline, with the aim of moving more female 
talent into the ‘Ready Now' succession 
positions. The mechanisms being used 
Group-wide to achieve this include:

■■ identifying female talent
■■ providing leadership and mentoring 

programmes
■■ launching ‘Aspire' – a programme used 

to fast track the development of high 
potential Vice Presidents to Director 
(of which the majority in the programme 
are female).

Successful leadership and governance 
comes from different experiences and 
perspectives, not just one point of view. 
Our commitment is to attract and retain a 
broad based pool of talent – not a particular 
type of person – and the Board Diversity 
Policy and the Committee terms of reference 
support this. Both are available at 
home.barclays/corporategovernance.

For additional information on diversity and 
inclusion, our Diversity Policy and data on the 
percentage of females in senior management 
positions, please see pages 28 and 31 
respectively.

The Board was 
delighted to announce 
the appointment of    
Dr. El-Erian, 
Ms Fitzpatrick and 
Dr. Gilvary as Non-
Executive Directors. 
Each will make a 
significant contribution 
to the effectiveness 
of the Board.

Delivering effectiveness
DIRECTORS' REPORT: BOARD NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE REPORT

■■ There may also be opportunities to 
increase the input to the Board from 
outside Barclays on a wider range of 
issues, thereby further strengthening 
decision-making and ensuring that Board 
members have the fullest understanding 
of the context for their decisions.

■■ Barclays should ensure that its ongoing, 
structured approach to workforce 
engagement includes appropriate 
opportunities for Board members 
to engage directly with employees, 
to help the Board take the issues of 
interest to employees into account 
in decision-making.

Review of Nominations 
Committee effectiveness
The performance of the Committee was 
assessed internally, in line with the approach 
adopted for all Board Committees in 2019. 
The process involved completion of a tailored 
questionnaire by Committee members and 
standing attendees.

The results confirm that the Committee 
is operating effectively. This year's review 
highlights that the Committee continues 
to be well constituted and that the role and 
responsibilities of the Committee are clear 
and well understood. The Committee's 
interaction with the Board, Board Committees 
and senior management is considered 
effective. In particular, this year's review 
noted the positive steps which had been taken 
to address feedback from the previous review 
on ensuring the same flow of information 
is received by all Non-Executive Directors 
in relation to discussions and decisions made 
by the Committee.

The review also noted that the Committee 
may benefit from a more formalised meeting 
schedule. It was acknowledged that due to 
the nature of the Committee's roles and 
responsibilities this is not always possible, 
but further consideration will be given to 
this during the year.

In response to a request to provide feedback 
on interaction with subsidiary committees, 
the review noted that interaction with the 
BBUKPLC nominations committee had been 
effective. Following the consolidation of the 
membership of the Committee with the BBPLC 
nominations committee, coverage of BBPLC 
matters within concurrent meetings was 
considered adequate, noting that it will 
benefit from further embedment.

 2019: Through the programme of deep dives, 
which covers a rolling 18-month period 
and reflects the Board's key priorities and 
objectives, and through the effort to address 
the deep dive topics effectively in the papers 
to the Board, the Committee believes that 
this recommendation has, in substance, 
been addressed. Time is now devoted 
to strategy and strategic issues at every 
meeting of the Board, rather than once a year. 

2019 Board effectiveness review
The 2019 Board effectiveness review was 
conducted internally, in line with the Code, 
and was led by the SID with support from 
the Company Secretary. The review followed 
a structured interview process with Board 
members, senior management and other 
stakeholders, including our auditors, building 
on past year's externally facilitated review. 

The review is an important part of the way 
Barclays monitors and improves Board 
performance and effectiveness; maximising 
strengths and highlighting areas for further 
development.

Feedback indicated that recent changes 
in the composition of the Board have made 
it more effective, with the new mix of skills 
and experience enhancing the quality 
of discussion. 

Board members commented that meetings 
are characterised by constructive dialogue on 
strategic issues, and healthy challenge in an 
open and collegiate environment. The quality 
of management's input to Board meetings 
is felt to have improved, in part as a result 
of more active Board engagement in shaping 
materials for debate.

The induction of the new Chairman has 
been effective, enabling him to quickly 
understand the organisation and provide 
effective challenge and a strong platform 
for inclusive debate.

The integration of BBPLC and BPLC board 
meetings is viewed as efficient, whilst still 
enabling the appropriate focus on matters 
relevant to each entity.

Recommendations
■■ The breadth and complexity of some 

issues may necessitate a deeper discussion 
than is currently possible in Board 
meetings. Consideration will be given 
to the best way to achieve this without 
significantly increasing demands on the 
Board's time.

■■ As Barclays, and the wider industry, 
becomes increasingly more digital, 
there may be benefit to adding greater 
technology expertise to the Board. 
This could be achieved either through 
greater external input, or by looking to 
expand or adjust Board membership.

Review of Board, Committee and 
individual Director effectiveness
Progress against 2018 Board 
effectiveness review
The 2018 externally-facilitated effectiveness 
review outlined the following key 
recommendations:

■■ Board size and composition: The 2018 
review highlighted that the Board, at 15 
members, was large relative to peers 
and suggested that a Board of 10 to12 
members is optimal, with 8 to 10 
Non-Executive Directors, provided that 
diversity, succession planning and skills 
mix criteria continue to be met. 

  2019: The size of the Board was reduced 
to 11 (post AGM) and is currently 13. 
The Committee believes that the size of the 
Board is now more appropriate, with more 
work to do to reduce it further in size, and 
that its effectiveness, and the balance of 
skills, experience and diversity on the 
Board, have been enhanced during 2019. 

■■ Culture, purpose and values: The 2018 
review recommended that the Board 
ensure that the Group's purpose and 
values are fully aligned with its culture 
and that all Directors lead by example 
and promote the desired culture. 

  2019: Deep dives have been held by the 
Board covering purpose, values and culture 
and considerable progress has been made 
in relation to these recommendations.

■■ Director training and development: 
The 2018 review recommended that 
enhanced training be provided for Board 
members and senior executives on UK 
corporate governance, and that refresher 
training sessions and more opportunities 
for site visits be made available. 

  2019: Training on UK corporate 
governance has been delivered in 2019 
to Non-Executive Directors and to key 
executives, and a new programme of 
training sessions for Directors has been 
implemented, with sessions held to date 
focusing on technical aspects of some 
of the more complex areas of the business, 
in particular within the CIB. Opportunities 
for site visits in the US and the UK have 
been made available to all Board members.

■■ Board objectives: The 2018 review 
recommended that to enable the Board 
to spend more time on longer-term 
and strategic issues a short set of annual 
objectives would help to bring focus 
to key issues and would result in papers 
and meetings being more effective.

Review of the effectiveness  
of the other Committees
In addition to reviewing its own effectiveness, 
the Committee also reviewed the outcomes 
of the effectiveness reviews conducted by 
the Audit, Remuneration and Risk Committees 
which had also been conducted by way of 
tailored questionnaire. You can read about 
those reviews in the individual Committee 
reports elsewhere in this Governance Report. 

Following consideration of the findings 
of the 2019 Board and Board Committee 
effectiveness reviews, the Directors remain 
satisfied that the Board and each of the 
Board Committees are operating effectively. 

Individual Director effectiveness
All Directors in office at the end of 2019 (with 
the exception of Matthew Lester who stepped 
down on 1 January 2020) were subject to an 
individual effectiveness review. The Chairman 
and the SID considered each Director's 
individual contribution to the Board as well as 
any feedback received as part of the broader 
Board and Committee effectiveness review. 
The reviews were conducted by the Chairman 
and the Chairman's review was conducted by 
the SID. The Committee also reviewed the 
independence of the Directors, and in the 
cases of Tim Breedon, Mike Ashley and 
Crawford Gillies, all of whom have served 
(or will have by the time of the 2020 AGM) 
on the Board for more than six years, their 
independence was subjected to a more 
rigorous review as required by the Code. 

Based on these reviews, and the additional 
review in respect of Mr. Staley described 
below, the Board accepted the view of the 
Committee that each Director proposed for 
election or re-election at the 2020 AGM 
continues to be effective, and contributes to 
the Company's long-term sustainable success. 

Director effectiveness assessment: 
disclosure of regulatory investigation
In accordance with the Code, all of the current 
Directors of the Company will be submitting 
themselves for election or re-election at the 
2020 AGM to be held on 7 May 2020, and will 
be unanimously recommended by the Board 
for election or re-election as appropriate. 
Further information in this regard will be set 
out in the Notice of Meeting which will be 
published in due course.

In deciding whether to recommend Jes Staley 
for re-election, the Board has carried out its 
usual formal and rigorous performance 
assessment, which it does in respect of the 
effectiveness of each of the Directors. As part 
of its determination in respect of Mr Staley, 
the Board has had regard to media reports 
in the past six months that have highlighted 
historical links between Mr Staley and 
Jeffrey Epstein. 

As has been widely reported, earlier in his 
career Mr Staley developed a professional 
relationship with Mr Epstein. In the summer 
of 2019, in light of the renewed media interest 
in the relationship, Mr Staley volunteered and 
gave to certain executives, and the Chairman, 
an explanation of his relationship with 
Mr Epstein. Mr Staley also confirmed 
to the Board that he has had no contact 
whatsoever with Mr Epstein at any time 
since taking up his role as Barclays Group 
CEO in December 2015.

The relationship between Mr Staley and 
Mr Epstein was the subject of an enquiry 
from the FCA, to which the Company 
responded. The FCA and the PRA 
subsequently commenced an investigation, 
which is ongoing, into Mr Staley's 
characterisation to the Company of his 
relationship with Mr Epstein and the 
subsequent description of that relationship 
in the Company's response to the FCA. 

Based on a review, conducted with the support 
of external counsel, of the information 
available to us and representations made 
by Mr Staley, the Board (the Executive 
Directors having been recused) believes that 
Mr Staley has been sufficiently transparent 
with the Company as regards the nature and 
extent of his relationship with Mr Epstein. 
Accordingly, Mr Staley retains the 
full confidence of the Board, and is being 
unanimously recommended for re-election 
at the 2020 AGM.

The Board will continue to co-operate fully 
with the regulatory investigation, and will 
provide a further update as and when it is 
appropriate to do so.

DIRECTORS' REPORT: BOARD RISK COMMITTEE REPORT

Effective risk management: 
designed to identify, assess 
and control our risks

As a British universal bank, Barclays is subject to a 
variety of financial, operational, legal and conduct risks.

Dear Fellow Shareholders 
During 2019, the Committee maintained 
its focus on the potential impact of macro-
economic developments and market volatility 
on the risk profile of the Group. These issues 
remain challenging and we continue to work 
with management to position the Group 
conservatively in response to a heightened 
risk environment. 

UK risks were the subject of particular 
attention due to the economic uncertainty 
arising from the planned withdrawal from the 
EU. The October 2019 withdrawal agreement 
and the subsequent General Election result 
have reduced political uncertainty significantly 
but the future trading relationship with the EU 
is yet to be agreed. Given the tight timetable 
and the potential economic consequences, 
this remains a significant area of risk. The 
Committee has also been active in ensuring 
the operational resilience of the Group should 
the UK leave the EU without reaching an 
agreement on the future trading relationship. 

We have continued to encourage 
management to manage consumer and 
corporate credit exposure in the UK in a 
cautious manner and this has helped the 
Group to limit losses and avoid a number 
of the high profile corporate failures seen 
during 2019. 

Other key risks with potential for wider 
contagion include those related to the 
US economy where underlying economic 
performance remains robust but growth 
has slowed and consumer and corporate 
indebtedness is high and growing. Political 
and trade tensions, notably with China and 
Europe, have increased and present a threat 
to growth globally. 

Despite the strength of the US economy 
in 2019, the Committee remains focused 
on the credit quality of our consumer and 
corporate lending portfolios. In particular, 
the US credit cards strategy was reviewed 
and the Committee supported a continued 
steady transition to a higher quality book 
and lower-risk new business mix. 

The Committee has also considered 
the ageing of the credit cycle and rising 
recessionary risks in our major markets. In the 
second half of 2019, central banks undertook 
synchronised rate cuts and other monetary 
easing measures, with the Federal Reserve 
Bank reversing its 2018 rate increases in the 
face of moderate inflationary pressure and a 
weaker growth outlook. This has supported 
asset markets but increased the margin 
pressures on banks from very low or negative 
interest rates, whilst also presenting 
operational challenges. Policy tools available 
to central banks to deal with further economic 
weakness are limited and with abundant 
liquidity influencing risk-pricing in financial 
markets, the potential exists for extreme 
market moves to occur, not least in response 
to policy errors. These risks are actively 
managed and the Committee maintains 
regular oversight of the overall risk profile of 
the Group's balance sheet and actions taken. 
The ongoing focus on book quality is 
evidenced by another positive impairment 
performance this year. 

The Committee again reviewed in detail with 
management the Group's leveraged finance 
business in light of continued concerns 
regarding reduced market liquidity, particularly 
for larger transactions, lower quality issues 
and more aggressive structures. The balance 
of risk and reward in this market continues 
to be acceptable and underwriting losses in 
the year were modest. However, management 
was encouraged to remain particularly vigilant 
to these trends. 

Barclays' strategy includes some expansion of 
structured credit exposures and an enhanced 
control framework has been established to 
control exposures and to ensure they are in 
line with strategy in both scale and type. 

The Committee also took on responsibility for 
Conduct risk following the dissolution of the 
Board Reputation Committee in September. 
The role of the Committee is to oversee the 
management of regulatory risk and challenge 
the business to continue to deliver fair 
outcomes for customers. We have welcomed 
the opportunity to achieve further alignment 
in the consideration of both financial and 
non-financial risks. In addition to focusing 
on the Conduct risk profile of our core 
businesses, the Committee has identified 
a number of key conduct themes requiring 
active management. 

Finally, the Committee reviewed the significant 
enhancements the Group has made in its 
approach to the management of the risks of 
climate change. Both physical and transition 
risks across all portfolios were considered in 
the context of a severe but plausible climate 
stress. This analysis will support the Group's 
response to the forthcoming Bank of England 
(BoE) industry-wide stress test. This progress 
was welcomed whilst acknowledging the 
need for risk management practices generally 
to evolve further across the whole industry in 
respect of climate change risk.

Operational risk
During the year, the Committee continued 
to monitor and challenge the progress being 
made by management in the identification, 
assessment and management of operational 
risk. A key part of this was the further delivery 
and embedding of work commenced in prior 
years. Two complementary risk management 
tools used by management are the RCSAs and 
Structured Scenario Assessments (SSAs).

The RCSAs give ‘day-to-day' coverage of the 
risk and control environment of the Group. 
They are built on a foundation of the actual 
processes the Group employs and the risks 
it faces from its activities. This approach 
enables management to better identify and 
manage operational risks going forward and 
also to review in detail risk events that have 
occurred in order to identify root causes.

The Committee continued to see progress 
on SSAs and a number of specific scenarios 
were reviewed during the course of the 
year covering both Conduct (e.g. mis-selling 
of products) and Non-Conduct (e.g. customer 
data compromise, supplier financial failure) 
scenarios. The SSAs are used to evaluate 
operational risk arising from more extreme 
but plausible situations and so complement 
the RCSA approach, in combination they 
enable the Committee to oversee the risk the 
Group faces at both ends of the risk likelihood 
spectrum. The SSAs are also an important 
input to our Operational risk stress testing 
and capital frameworks. 

Risk appetite and risk models
One of the most important roles of the 
Committee is to recommend to the Board 
an appropriate risk appetite for the Group. 
This represents the amount of risk the Group 
is able to take to earn an appropriate return 
whilst meeting minimum internal and 
regulatory capital requirements in a severe but 
plausible stress environment. The Committee 
analyses Barclays performance in both its 
internally-generated stress tests and those 
run externally by such bodies as the BoE, the 
European Banking Authority and the Federal 
Reserve Board, and following such analysis, 
will recommend adjustments to the Group's 
overall risk profile. 

For our internal stress test, the Committee 
received a detailed briefing on the process 
being applied and was satisfied that the 
internally-generated scenario was appropriately 
calibrated, and also stressed the particular 
vulnerabilities of the Group. They were further 
satisfied that the Group would meet internal 
and regulatory requirements for capital 
and liquidity in such a scenario.

The Committee continued to oversee the 
improvement of model risk management 
in the Group and the ongoing validation of 
our models, with specific progress and 
methodology enhancements in the model 
outputs supporting our stress tests, including 
the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment 
Process (ICAAP) and Internal Liquidity 
Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP). 
Our models are the core foundation upon 
which the majority of our internal assessment 
processes run. The Committee is pleased to 
report that progress has continued during 
2019 to embed the Model risk management 
framework as evidenced by an increasingly 
stable model inventory and further 
improvements in documentation and control. 
However, models remain a key risk area for 
the Group, and the Committee is closely 
monitoring the development of the 
Group's approach.

Risk function
The Committee is responsible for ensuring the 
independence and effectiveness of the Risk 
function whose primary role is the oversight 
and challenge of risk-taking as the second 
line of defence. It accomplishes this by 
establishing the policies, limits, rules and 
constraints under which first line activities 
shall be performed, consistent with the 
Group's risk appetite and through monitoring 
the performance of the first line of defence 
against these policies, limits and constraints. 
The Committee's responsibilities include 
designing a consistent classification of the 
risks faced by the Group in order to organise 
their management and reporting; designing 
and operating the process of setting risk 
appetite and material limits for the Group 
as a whole and its main entities; setting 
or approving strategies for approvals of 
transactions, and sanctioning large individual 
agreements; and establishing key controls 
requirements to which customer-facing areas 
of Barclays must adhere in the conduct of 
their businesses.

The Committee reviewed the Risk function's 
own assessment of its capability in late 2019 
which showed the function continues to meet 
regulatory expectations in providing effective 
and independent oversight with strong 
stewardship and technical competency. 
Progress continued in 2019 to ensure systems 
and strategic architecture are fit for purpose 
with further enhancement on technology 
capabilities due from the delivery of further 
strategic infrastructure in 2020.

Compliance function
The Compliance function is responsible for 
the overall management and oversight of 
Conduct and Reputation risk management 
practices as the second line of defence. 
Compliance participates in the prevention, 
detection and management of breaches of 
applicable laws, rules, regulations and relevant 
procedures and has a key role in helping 
Barclays achieve the right conduct outcomes. 
The Committee supports the Compliance 
function to be independent from operational 
functions and have sufficient authority, 
stature, resources and access to the 
management body.

The Committee monitored the delivery of the   
Compliance function's Annual Plan for 2019 
and approved the Compliance function's 
Annual Plan for 2020. 

Committee effectiveness
The 2019 Committee effectiveness review  
was conducted in line with the Code. 
This internal review involved completion 
of a tailored questionnaire by Committee 
members, senior management and other 
stakeholders, including our auditors, building 
on the prior year's externally-facilitated 
review. The review is an important part of 
the way Barclays monitors and improves 
Committee performance and effectiveness, 
maximising strengths and highlighting areas 
for further development.

The results of the review were positive and 
indicated that the Committee is operating 
effectively; and that it provides an effective 
and broad level of challenge and oversight 
of the areas within its remit. During the year, 
the Committee took on oversight of Conduct 
and Compliance matters, following 
re-allocation of the responsibilities from 
the Reputation Committee.

DIRECTORS' REPORT: BOARD RISK COMMITTEE REPORT

Effective risk management: 
designed to identify, assess 
and control our risks

Following the consolidation of the 
membership of the Committee with the BBPLC 
risk committee, coverage of BBPLC matters 
within concurrent meetings was considered 
appropriate, noting that it will benefit from 
further embedment.

Looking ahead
In 2020, the Committee will continue to focus 
on the impact of the external environment 
on the Group's risk profile, particularly as the 
negotiations on the future trade relationship 
with the EU progress and the broader 
geopolitical context evolves in the run 
up to the US presidential election.

Primary activities
The Committee has diligently discharged its responsibilities in 2019, reviewing Group exposures in the context of the current and emerging 
risks facing Barclays. It has sought to promote a strong culture of disciplined risk management.

Area of focus Matter addressed Role of the Committee Conclusion/action taken

Risk appetite 
and stress 
testing
i.e. the level of 
risk the Group 
chooses to take 
in pursuit of 
its business 
objectives, 
including testing 
whether the 
Group's financial 
position and 
risk profile 
provide sufficient 
resilience to 
withstand the 
impact of 
severe economic 
scenarios.

The risk context 
to the MTP, 
the financial 
parameters and 
constraints and 
mandate and 
scale limits for 
specific business 
risk exposures; 
the Group's 
internal stress 
testing exercises, 
including scenario 
selection and 
financial 
constraints, stress 
testing themes 
and the results 
and implications 
of stress tests, 
including those 
run by the BoE.

■■ To advise the Board on the 
appropriate risk appetite and 
tolerance for the principal risks, 
including the proposed overall 
Group risk appetite and limits.

■■ To discuss and agree stress loss 
and mandate and scale limits, 
for Credit risk, Market risk and 
Treasury and Capital risk.

■■ To consider and approve 
internal stress test themes 
and the financial constraints 
and scenarios for stress testing 
risk appetite for the MTP.

■■ To evaluate the results of 
the BoE's annual cyclical stress 
test and the BoE's Biennial 
Exploratory Scenario.

■■ To consider the Federal Reserve 
Board's feedback of the Barclays 
US LLC's Comprehensive Capital 
Analysis and Review (CCAR) 
following the submission of 
the CCAR stress test results.

The Committee reviewed and recommended the proposed 
risk appetite to the Board for approval. It discussed and 
approved the 2019 mandate and scale limits for the Group, 
which included changes to A-level stress loss limits.

The Committee reviewed proposed enhancements to the 
Group's stress testing processes and models. It also attended 
a stress test briefing providing additional background and 
context to aid the review and approval of various stress tests. 

The Committee reviewed and approved the scenarios for, and 
the financial results of, the MTP internal stress test exercise, 
and on the basis that the results remained within the Group's 
risk appetite constraints, subsequently recommended the 
MTP to the Board for approval. It gave particular attention 
to the severity of the internal stress test scenario, as well as 
the application of ‘perfect foresight' methodology through 
the test. 

The Committee evaluated the results of the 2018 Annual 
Cyclical Scenario, which included increased focus on strategic 
management actions, and approved the 2019 submission to 
the BoE. Similarly, the Committee approved Barclays' initial 
Biennial Exploratory Scenario submission to the BoE. 

The Committee received updates on the 2019 CCAR 
submission, and reviewed the feedback from the Federal 
Reserve Board following the release of the results.

DIRECTORS' REPORT: BOARD RISK COMMITTEE REPORT

Effective risk management: 
designed to identify, assess 
and control our risks

Area of focus Matter addressed Role of the Committee Conclusion/action taken

Capital and 
funding
i.e. having 
sufficient capital 
and financial 
resources to 
meet the Group's 
regulatory 
requirements and 
its obligations as 
they fall due, to 
maintain its credit 
rating, to support 
growth and 
strategic options.

The trajectory 
to achieving 
required 
regulatory and 
internal targets 
and capital and 
leverage ratios.

■■ To review, on a regular basis, 
capital performance against 
plan, tracking the capital 
trajectory, any challenges and 
opportunities, and regulatory 
policy developments.

■■ To assess, on a regular basis, 
liquidity performance against 
both internal and regulatory 
requirements.

■■ To monitor capital and 
funding requirements.

The Committee examined and supported the forecast 
capital and funding trajectory and the actions identified by 
management to manage the Group's capital position, taking 
into account the potential impact of macroeconomic factors. 

The Committee considered and approved the Group's capital 
adequacy assessment, together with the methodologies 
and results of the reverse stress test for submission of the 
2019 ICAAP, as well as approving the Group's 2019 ILAAP. 
Committee members also attended an ICAAP and ILAAP 
briefing to further support their review and approval of the 
submissions. The Committee evaluated regulatory feedback 
on the ICAAP and ILAAP and oversaw the continued 
improvement of the processes.

The Committee reviewed and agreed with management's 
approach to an out-of-cycle refresh of the Group's 2018 
ICAAP following an increase to PPI provisioning.

The Committee reviewed and scrutinised the Group Recovery 
Plan, which forms a part of the Group's capital and liquidity 
risk management framework, and confirmed that it was fit for 
purpose, ahead of its presentation to the Board for approval.

The Committee approved risk appetite constraints in relation 
to capital and funding which require capital and liquidity 
ratios to remain at a level where all internal and regulatory 
requirements, and all obligations as they fall due can be met 
under stress. 

Political and 
economic risk
i.e. the impact on 
the Group's risk 
profile of political 
and economic 
developments and 
macroeconomic 
conditions.

The potential 
impact on the 
Group's risk 
profile of 
geopolitical 
developments, 
as well as 
continuing to 
monitor the 
political and 
economic 
impact of 
Brexit scenarios.

■■ To review and discuss plans 
for the impacts of Brexit under 
various withdrawal scenarios.

■■ To consider trends in the UK 
and US economies.

■■ To assess the transmission 
effects of Chinese/US trade 
tensions and monitor the 
impacts of slowing growth 
in China.

■■ To review exposures to 
emerging markets as a 
result of volatility in these 
markets arising from the 
impact of global political 
and economic events.

The Committee monitored the potential risk impacts of 
Brexit, giving particular consideration to the impact risk of 
an exit without an agreement in place. It received updates on, 
and oversaw management's preparations for, Brexit from a 
risk perspective, reviewing in particular any potential impact 
to the capital and liquidity positions. 

The Committee monitored the Group's performance in 
light of a backdrop of uncertain global political and economic 
conditions, with particular focus on Barclays' European 
exposures. 

Other key material risk themes discussed and monitored by 
the Committee included rising global debt and the response 
of Central Banks, the low rates environment and potential 
for weakness in US consumer credit. 

The Committee received updates on the progress of the 
global transition to alternative risk-free reference rates 
including on preparations by the LIBOR Transition 
Programme to manage and mitigate the financial and 
non-financial risks associated with the transition.

Credit risk
i.e. the potential 
for financial loss 
if customers 
fail to fulfil their 
contractual 
obligations.

Conditions in 
the UK housing 
market; levels of 
UK consumer 
indebtedness; and 
the performance 
of the UK and US 
cards businesses, 
including levels 
of impairment.

■■ To assess conditions in the UK 
property market and monitor 
signs of stress.

■■ To monitor how management 
was tracking and responding 
to persistent rising levels of 
consumer indebtedness, 
particularly unsecured credit 
in both the UK and US.

■■ To review leveraged finance 
portfolios in order to assess 
these were within risk appetite 
and manageable limits.

■■ To review business development 
activities in the CIB.

The Committee continued to iterate the need to ensure 
appropriate credit selection and discipline when selecting 
business, and the importance of consumer profiling to 
achieve improved risk selection. It encouraged management 
to consider the impact of all associated risks.

The Committee oversaw improvements to the control 
environment in the US cards business, and received updates 
on the impacts of US economic conditions on the portfolio. 

The Committee was updated on programmes initiated to 
assist customers to meet their contractual credit obligations 
in the UK including the review of practices in relation to 
customer affordability and persistent debt. The Committee 
also reviewed the procedures implemented to manage 
corporate exposure to UK sectors primarily driven by 
consumer spending.

The Committee received an update on the leveraged finance 
business, which continues to be one of the largest businesses 
within the Investment Bank, noting that portfolios were 
within appetite and that management had a strong focus on 
regulatory compliance in this area. The Committee also 
received updates on the structured finance business, noting 
the growth in this activity and the fact that exposures 
remained within appetite.

Operational 
risk
i.e. costs arising 
from human 
factors, 
inadequate 
processes and 
systems or 
external events.

The Group's 
operational 
risk capital 
requirements 
and any material 
changes to the 
Group's 
operational risk 
profile and 
performance 
of specific 
operational risks 
against agreed 
risk appetite.

■■ To track operational risk 
key indicators.

■■ To consider specific areas of 
operational risks, including 
fraud, conduct risk, cyber risk, 
execution risk, technology and 
data, including the controls 
that had been put in place 
for managing and avoiding 
such risks.

■■ To review Barclays' approach 
to scenario analyses as a risk 
management tool and assess 
a range of SSAs which had been 
created to support assessments 
and management of tail risk 
within the business, stress 
testing and risk tolerance.

The Committee continued to focus its attention on the 
financial and capital impacts of operational risk. 

The Committee approved and recommended the 2019 
Operational Risk Tolerance Statement to the Board, which 
included financial loss appetites for fraud and transaction 
operations for the first time.

The Committee used SSAs to evaluate operational risks that 
might arise in extreme but plausible scenarios. They heard 
updates on SSAs, including, those in relation to unauthorised 
trading and supplier risk, and requested that SSAs continue 
to be presented in 2020, specifically those in relation to data 
privacy and misuse.

DIRECTORS' REPORT: BOARD RISK COMMITTEE REPORT

Effective risk management: 
designed to identify, assess 
and control our risks

Area of focus Matter addressed Role of the Committee Conclusion/action taken

Model risk
i.e. the risk of the 
potential adverse 
consequences 
from financial 
assessments or 
decisions based 
on incorrect or 
misused model 
outputs and 
reports.

Model risk 
governance.

■■ To evaluate the appropriateness 
of the Model risk management 
framework, and monitor 
progress on the implementation 
of an enhanced modelling 
framework, including receiving 
updates on findings in relation 
to specific modelling processes.

The Committee reviewed and approved the Model Risk 
Tolerance Criteria for 2019, which included CCAR models at the 
Committee's request. The Committee maintained oversight of 
Model risk and in particular monitored planned improvements 
to Barclays' Model risk management framework and ongoing 
upgrade plans. The Committee monitored progress to ensure 
that the scope of Model risk management implementation was 
expanded to bring into governance non-modelled methods 
used in a number of large model frameworks. 

The Committee also maintained oversight of the models used 
in the 2019 CCAR, ICAAP and ILAAP submissions, and related 
stress test processes to ensure they were materially brought 
into governance by management. The Committee recognised 
the added value that stronger model governance had on the 
quality of these submissions.

The Committee sought, and were provided with, assurance from 
the Independent Validation Unit of the validation of models in 
relation to specific processes, including ICAAP and ILAAP. 

Risk 
framework and 
governance

The frameworks, 
policies and tools 
in place to 
support effective 
risk management 
and oversight.

■■ To track the progress of 
significant risk management 
projects, including progress on 
achieving compliance with the 
Basel Committee for Banking 
Supervision (BCBS239) risk data 
aggregation principles and the 
RCSA process across the Group.

■■ To assess risk management 
matters raised by Barclays' 
regulators and the actions 
being taken by management 
to respond.

■■ To review the design of the 
ERMF.

The Committee monitored the delivery of an action plan 
created by management to review areas identified for potential 
improvement identified by the independent assessment of the 
design and effectiveness of the Risk function completed in 2018.

The annual update to the ERMF was recommended to the 
Board by the Committee. The Committee discussed and 
approved an annual refresh of the Principal Risk Frameworks.

The Committee reviewed the results of the 2018 RCSAs 
across the Group and recognised that its output was 
extremely useful to inform internal processes, but also 
to facilitate helpful dialogue with the regulator. 

The Committee monitored management's progress in 
achieving compliance with all aspects of BCBS239, and 
received updates on the level of implementation throughout 
the year recognising the progress made towards achieving 
full compliance by the end of 2020. 

In relation to climate change, the Committee received an 
update on the associated financial and operational risks and 
endorsed management's approach to the management of 
those risks, which included the establishment of a Climate 
Change Financial Risk and Operational Risk Policy and the 
inclusion of climate change in the ERMF and Principal Risk 
Frameworks. 

Remuneration The scope of any 
risk adjustments 
to be taken into 
account by 
the Board 
Remuneration 
Committee 
when making 
remuneration 
decisions for 2019.

■■ To debate the Risk function's 
view of performance, making 
a recommendation to the 
Remuneration Committee on 
the financial and operational 
risk factors to be taken into 
account in remuneration 
decisions for 2019.

The Committee discussed the report of the Group Chief Risk 
Officer and considered, and reported to the Remuneration 
Committee on, the proposal put forward in relation to the 
impact of relevant risk factors in determining 2019 
remuneration.

Conduct Risk*
i.e. the risk of 
detriment to 
customers from 
the inappropriate 
supply of financial 
services.

Conduct robust 
reviews of any 
current and 
emerging risks 
arising from the 
inappropriate 
provision of 
financial services, 
including 
instances of 
wilful negligent 
misconduct. 

■■ To receive updates from 
management on Conduct risk 
and consider performance 
against key Conduct risk 
indicators, and the status of 
initiatives in place to address 
those risks to further strengthen 
the culture of the business.

■■ To review the effectiveness of 
the Conduct risk framework and 
approve any amendments to it.

■■ Reviewed the Compliance 
function's Annual Compliance 
Plan.

The Committee accepted oversight of Conduct risk following 
the disbanding of the Reputation Committee in September 
2019. Since then, the Committee has received a deep dive on 
Conduct risk which provided a detailed overview of recent 
developments made in the area as well as an update on the 
current Conduct risk environment, and proposed areas of 
focus for the future. 

The Committee approved the revised Conduct risk 
management framework which provided greater clarity 
on roles and responsibilities in relation to Conduct risk 
compared to previous versions. The Committee also 
approved the Annual Compliance Plan which contained 
key initiatives which would be implemented in 2020. 

* The Risk Committee remit extended to include the oversight of Conduct risk and Compliance on 25 September 2019, following the disbanding of the Reputation Committee.

Board leadership and 
company purpose 

Role of the Board
As highlighted earlier in this report, 
our governance is structured to deliver an 
effective and entrepreneurial Board which:

■■ is effective in providing challenge, advice 
and support to management

■■ provides checks and balances and 
encourages constructive challenge

■■ drives informed, collaborative and 
accountable decision-making

■■ creates long-term sustainable value for our 
shareholders, having regard to our other 
stakeholders.

Culture
The Barclays Way sets the framework for 
achieving a dynamic and positive culture. 
The Board supports The Barclays Way and the 
Barclays Purpose and Values. It promotes 
personal accountability and leadership and 
monitors our culture to satisfy itself as to the 
alignment of Barclays' culture to its purpose, 
values and strategy. See pages 34 and 128 for 
more details.

Our whistleblowing policy enables employees 
to raise any matters of concern anonymously 
and is embedded into our business. For more 
detail please refer to page 57 of the Audit 
Committee Report. 

Relations with shareholders 
and stakeholders
The Board recognises the importance of 
listening to, and understanding the views of, 
our shareholders and stakeholders in order 
to inform the Board's decision-making. 
Our comprehensive Investor Relations 
engagement helps us to understand 
investor views about Barclays, which are 
communicated regularly to the Board, 
and our Chairman engages with shareholders 
on governance and related matters. 
Our shareholder communication guidelines 
are available on our website at 
home.barclays/investorrelations. Our 
approach to stakeholder engagement is 
described on pages 14 to 17.

Institutional investors
Our engagement with institutional investors 
increased throughout the year as compared 
to prior years.

In 2019, the Directors, in conjunction with the 
senior executive team and Investor Relations 
colleagues, participated in investor meetings, 
seminars and conferences across many 
locations, reflecting the diverse nature of 
our equity and debt institutional ownership. 
We held conference calls/webcasts for our 
quarterly results briefings and an in-person 
presentation of our 2018 full year results for 
both our equity and fixed income investors. 

During 2019, discussions with investors 
included, but were not limited to:

■■ introducing our new Group Chairman, 
Nigel Higgins

■■ addressing shareholder queries relating to 
the requisitioned resolution at the AGM to 
appoint Mr Edward Bramson as a Director 
of the Company

■■ the continued digitisation of Barclays 
and the value being created by BX in 
improving the efficiency of our cost base

■■ topics including risk management and 
steps taken to mitigate the potential 
impact from Brexit, as well as ESG factors, 
our CIB strategy, and valuation and 
capital levels

■■ corporate governance policy and practice.

Private shareholders
During 2019, we continued to communicate 
with our private shareholders through our 
shareholder mailings and via the information 
available on our website and through our 
AGM. Shareholders can also choose to sign up 
to Shareview so that they receive information 
about Barclays PLC and their shareholding 
directly by email. We continue to endeavour 
to trace shareholders who did not take up 
their share entitlement following the Rights 
Issue in September 2013, and offer a Share 
Dealing Service aimed at shareholders with 
relatively small shareholdings for whom it 
might otherwise be uneconomical to deal in 
Barclays shares. For more detail, please see 
pages 338 to 339.

How we comply
DIRECTORS' REPORT

The 2018 UK Corporate 
Governance Code 
As Barclays PLC is listed on the London 
Stock Exchange, we apply the principles 
and provisions of the Code, as set out 
below. A revised version of the Code 
was published in 2018, and came into 
effect for our financial year beginning 
on 1 January 2019 and accordingly, 
Barclays PLC has reported against 
the requirements of the Code in this 
annual report. 

A copy of the Code can be found 
at frc.org.uk. For the year ended 
31 December 2019, and as at the date 
of this report, we are pleased to confirm 
that we complied in full with its 
principles and provisions.

Disclosure Guidance 
and Transparency Rules 
By virtue of the information included in this 
Governance section of the Annual Report, 
we comply with the corporate governance 
statement requirements of the FCA's 
Disclosure Guidance and Transparency 
Rules. Certain additional information that 
is required to be disclosed pursuant to 
DTR7.2.6 can be found on pages 80 to 84.

New York Stock Exchange 
(NYSE)
Barclays is permitted by NYSE rules to 
follow UK corporate governance practices 
instead of those applied in the US. 
However, any significant variations must 
be explained in Barclays' Form 20-F filing, 
which can be accessed from the Securities 
and Exchange Commission's EDGAR 
database or on our website,

Responsibility for the day-to-day management 
of the Group is delegated to the Group Chief 
Executive Officer who is supported in this role 
by the ExCo. Further information on the 
membership of the ExCo can be found on 
page 47.

As a Board we have set out our expectations 
of each Director in Barclays' Charter of 
Expectations. This includes role profiles and 
the behaviours and competencies required for 
each role on the Board, namely the Chairman, 
Deputy Chairman (to the extent one is 
required), SID, Non-Executive Directors, 
Executive Directors and Committee Chairs. 
Pursuant to the Charter of Expectations, 
Non-Executive Directors provide effective 
oversight and scrutiny, strategic guidance and 
constructive challenge, whilst holding the 
Executive Directors to account against their 
agreed performance objectives. The Non-
Executive Directors, led by the Nominations 
Committee, have primary responsibility 
for the appointment and removal of the 
Executive Directors. 

The SID provides a sounding board for the 
Chairman, acts as an intermediary for the 
other Directors when necessary, and is 
available to shareholders if they have concerns 
that have not been addressed through the 
normal channels.

The Charter of Expectations is reviewed 
annually to ensure it remains relevant, 
and accurately reflects the requirements 
of the Code and the Regulations, and 
industry best practice. A copy of the 
Charter of Expectations can be found at 
home.barclays/corporategovernance.

Information provided to the Board
It is the responsibility of the Chairman, 
as set out in our Charter of Expectations, 
to ensure that Board agendas are focused on 
key strategy, risk, performance and other 
value creation issues, and that members of 
the Board receive timely and high-quality 
information to enable them to make sound 
decisions and promote the success of the 
Company. Working in collaboration with 
the Chairman, the Company Secretary is 
responsible for ensuring good governance and 
information flow, to ensure an effective Board.

Throughout the year, both the Executive 
Directors and senior executives keep the 
Board informed of key business developments 
through regular updates. These are in 
addition to the presentations that the Board 
and Board Committees receive as part of 
their formal meetings. Directors are able to 
seek independent and professional advice 
at Barclays' expense, if required, to enable 
them to fulfil their obligations as members 
of the Board.

Colleague engagement  
The Group has a long-standing commitment 
to the importance and value of colleague 
engagement. Our colleagues drive our 
success. You can read more about our 
commitment to colleagues and our workforce 
engagement in the Our people and culture 
section on pages 28 to 31. 

Conflicts of interest
In accordance with the Companies Act 2006 
and the Articles of Association (the Articles), 
the Board has the authority to authorise 
conflicts of interest, and this ensures that the 
influence of third parties does not 
compromise the independent judgement of 
the Board. Directors are required to declare 
any potential or actual conflicts of interest 
that could interfere with their ability to act in 
the best interests of the Group. The Company 
Secretary maintains a conflicts register, which 
is a record of actual and potential conflicts, 
together with any Board authorisation of the 
conflict. The authorisations are for an 
indefinite period but are reviewed annually by 
the Nominations Committee, which also 
considers the effectiveness of the process for 
authorising Directors' conflicts of interest. The 
Board retains the power to vary or terminate 
these authorisations at any time.

Division of responsibilities 
Roles on the Board
Executive and Non-Executive Directors 
share the same duties. However, in line with 
the principles of the Code, a clear division 
of responsibilities has been established. 
The Chairman is responsible for:

■■ leading the Board and its overall 
effectiveness

■■ demonstrating objective judgement
■■ promoting a culture of openness and 

constructive challenge and debate 
between all Directors

■■ facilitating constructive board relations 
and the effective contribution of all 
Non-Executive Directors 

■■ ensuring Directors receive accurate, 
clear and timely information.

Our AGM
The Board and the senior executive team 
consider our AGM as a key date for shareholder 
engagement, particularly with our private 
shareholders. A number of Directors, including 
the Chairman, are available for informal 
discussion before or after the meeting.

All of the resolutions proposed by the Board at 
the 2019 AGM were considered on a poll and 
were passed with votes ‘For' ranging from 
70.79% to 99.87% of the total votes cast. 
Resolution 24 of the AGM was a requisitioned 
resolution submitted by Sherborne Investors 
Management LP to appoint Mr Edward 
Bramson as a Director of the Company and 
the Board recommended shareholders to vote 
against it. The resolution was considered on a 
poll and was not passed, with votes ‘Against' 
being 87.21% of the total votes cast.

At the 2019 AGM, the vote on the 2018 
Directors' Remuneration Report (Resolution 2) 
was passed with 70.79% of votes cast in 
favour. For further information on Barclays' 
response to the significant vote against the 
2018 Directors' Remuneration Report, please 
see page 121.

The Board has decided to hold the 2020 AGM 
in Glasgow and thereafter expects to alternate 
AGM venues between London and a venue 
other than London where we have a 
significant business or customer presence. 
The 2020 AGM will be held on 7 May 2020 at 
11:00am at the Scottish Events Campus (SEC) 
in Glasgow, Scotland.

Stakeholder engagement 
The Board continues to seek to understand 
all stakeholders' views, and the impact of our 
behaviour and business on customers and 
clients, colleagues, suppliers, communities 
and society more broadly. Accordingly, the 
Board monitors key indicators across areas 
such as culture, citizenship, conduct, and 
customer and client satisfaction on an 
ongoing basis. In 2019, we built on 
conversations started at the AGM to engage 
in a continuing dialogue with NGOs and other 
interest groups, to improve our understanding 
of emerging and existing environmental and 
societal topics. We will publish the Barclays 
ESG Report in March 2020, which will be 
made available on our website at home.
barclays/annualreport.

Throughout 2019, we have engaged with 
these stakeholders through participation in 
forums and round tables and joined industry, 
sector and topic debates and this will continue 
in 2020.

For more detail, please see  
pages 14 to 17.

DIRECTORS' REPORT

Attendance
Directors are expected to attend every Board meeting. In 2019, attendance was very strong both at scheduled and additional meetings (including 
those called at short notice), reflected in the table below. The Chairman also met privately with the Non-Executive Directors ahead of three Board 
meetings. If, owing to exceptional circumstances, a Director was not able to attend a Board meeting he or she ensured that his or her views were 
made known to the Chairman in advance of the meeting. In addition, the SID met the other Non-Executive Directors individually, without the 
Chairman, to appraise the Chairman's performance, the details of which are included on page 65.

Composition of the Board
In line with the requirements of the Code, 
a majority of the Board is comprised of 
independent Non-Executive Directors. We 
consider the independence of our Non-
Executive Directors annually, having regard to 
the independence criteria set out in the Code. 
As part of this process, the Board keeps under 
review the length of tenure of all Directors, 
which can affect independence. The 
independence of Tim Breedon, Mike Ashley 
and Crawford Gillies – all of whom have served  
(or will have by the time of the 2020 AGM) on 
the Board for more than six years – was 
subjected to a more rigorous review as 
recommended by the Code. The Board 
remains satisfied that the lengths of their 
tenure have no impact on their respective 
levels of independence or the effectiveness of 
their contributions. During 2019, the previous 
Chairman and the following Non-Executive 
Directors stepped down from the Board. None 
of these Directors raised any concerns about 
the operation of the Board or management:

■■ John McFarlane
■■ Dambisa Moyo
■■ Reuben Jeffery
■■ Mike Turner
■■ Sir Gerry Grimstone 
■■ Matthew Lester

The Nominations Committee Report describes 
the renewal of the Board in 2019, and steps 
taken to further strengthen the Board.

Time commitment
All potential new Directors are asked 
to disclose their other significant  
commitments. The Nominations Committee 
then takes this into account when considering 
a proposed appointment to ensure that 
Directors can discharge their responsibilities 
to Barclays effectively. This means not only 
attending and preparing for formal Board 
and Committee meetings, but also making 
time to understand the business, and to 
undertake training. As stated in our Charter 
of Expectations, the time commitment is 
agreed with each Non-Executive Director on 
an individual basis. In addition, all Directors 
must seek approval before accepting any 
significant new commitment. Set out below 
is the average time commitment expected for 
the role of Non-Executive Directors and the 
other Non-Executive positions on the Board.

Following careful review, the expected time 
commitments for Non-Executive Directors, 
and for the Chairs of the Audit and Risk 
Committees, were increased as set out below.

Time commitment

Role

Expected time 
commitment (increased 
during the year)

Chairman Equivalent to up to 80% 
of a full-time position.

Senior 
Independent 
Director

As required to fulfil 
the role.

Non-Executive 
Director

35–40 days per year 
(membership of one 
Board Committee included, 
increasing to 50 days a 
year if a member of two 
Board Committees). This 
expectation was increased 
from 30 days and 40 
days respectively.

Committee 
Chairs

At least 80 days per 
year (including Non-
Executive Director time 
commitment) for Risk and 
Audit Committee Chairs, 
increased from 60 days, 
and at least 60 days for the 
Remuneration Committee 
Chair.

Where circumstances require it, all Directors 
are expected to commit additional time as 
necessary to their work on the Board. The 
Company Secretary maintains a record of 
each Director's commitments. For the 
year ended 31 December 2019 and as at the 
date of publication, the Board is satisfied that 
none of the Directors is over-committed and 
that each of the Directors allocates sufficient 
time to his or her role in order to discharge 
their responsibilities effectively.

Composition, succession 
and evaluation 
The Company has a Nominations Committee, 
the purpose and activities of which are 
contained in the Nominations Committee 
Report on pages 61 to 65.

Board appointments 
All appointments to the Board and senior 
management are viewed through a diversity 
lens and are based on merit and objective 
criteria, which focus on the skills and 
experience required for the Board's 
effectiveness and the delivery of the Group 
strategy. Board appointments are made 
following a rigorous and transparent process 
facilitated by the Nominations Committee, 
with the aid of an external search consultancy 
firm. You can read more about the work of the 
Nominations Committee on pages 61 to 65. 

Diversity across the Group remains a key area 
of focus. For more detail on our actions to 
increase diversity please see pages 28 to 31. 

The Nominations Committee regularly 
reviews the composition of the Board, 
Board Committees and the ExCo. It frequently 
considers the skills required for the Board, its 
Committees and the ExCo, identifying the core 
competencies, diversity and experience 
required. This, along with the annual 
evaluation, helps to refresh the thinking on 
Board, Committee and ExCo composition and 
to determine a timeline for proposed new 
appointments. For the Board, it is standard 
practice to appoint any new Non-Executive 
Director or Chairman for an initial three-year 
term, subject to annual re-election at the 
AGM, which may be extended for up to a 
further three-year term. As such, Non-
Executive Directors typically serve up to a total 
of six years.

All Directors are subject to election or 
re-election each year by shareholders at 
the AGM.

Each year we carry out an effectiveness review 
in order to evaluate our performance as a 
Board, as well as the performance of each 
of the Board Committees and individual 
Directors. More information on the 2019 
Board evaluation and effectiveness review 
can be found on pages 64 to 65.

How we comply
DIRECTORS' REPORT

Risk management and internal control
The Directors are responsible for ensuring that 
management maintains an effective system 
of risk management and internal control and 
for assessing its effectiveness. Such a system 
is designed to identify, evaluate and manage, 
rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives and can only 
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss.

The Group is committed to operating within a 
strong system of internal control. Barclays has 
an overarching framework that sets out the 
approach of the Group to internal governance, 
The Barclays Guide. This establishes the 
mechanisms, principles and processes 
through which management implements the 
strategy set by the Board.

Processes are in place for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the Principal Risks 
facing the Group in accordance with the 
‘Guidance on Risk Management, Internal 
Control and Related Financial and Business 
Reporting, published by the FRC. A key 
component of The Barclays Guide is the ERMF. 
The purpose of the ERMF is to identify and set 
minimum requirements in respect of the main 
risks to the strategic objectives of the Group. 
There are eight Principal Risks under the 
ERMF: Credit risk, Market risk, Treasury and 
Capital risk, Operational risk, Model risk, 
Reputation risk, Conduct risk and Legal risk. 
The system of risk management and internal 
control is set out in the risk frameworks 
relating to each of our eight Principal Risks 
and the Barclays Control Framework, which 
details requirements for the delivery of control 
responsibilities. Group-wide frameworks, 
policies and standards enable Barclays to 
meet regulators' expectations relating to 
internal control and assurance.

Audit, Risk and Internal Control
Accountability 
Internal governance processes have been 
developed to ensure the effective operation of 
the individual boards and board committees 
of each of BPLC, BBUKPLC and BBPLC 
respectively, in recognition of the fact that this 
is key to the development and execution of 
the Group's strategy. Generally, there is one set 
of rules for the Group. Group-wide 
frameworks, policies and standards are 
required to be adopted throughout the Group 
unless local laws or regulations (or the 
ring-fencing obligations applicable to  
BBUKPLC) require otherwise, or the ExCo 
decides otherwise in a particular instance.

The Company has an Audit Committee and a 
Risk Committee. The purposes and activities 
of the Audit and Risk Committees are 
contained within their respective reports on 
pages 52 and 66 respectively.

Internal and external audit functions
The Board together with the Audit Committee 
is responsible for ensuring the independence 
and effectiveness of the internal and external 
audit functions. For this reason, the Audit 
Committee members met regularly with the 
Group Chief Internal Auditor and external 
audit partner, without management present. 
The appointment and removal of the Group 
Chief Internal Auditor is a matter reserved to 
the Audit Committee and the appointment, 
and removal, of the external auditors, is a 
matter reserved to the Board. Neither task is 
delegated to management. This is explained in 
detail on pages 52 to 60 of the Audit 
Committee report.

Company's position and prospects
The Board, together with the Audit 
Committee, is responsible for ensuring the 
integrity of this Annual Report and that the 
financial statements as a whole present a 
fair, balanced and understandable assessment 
of the Group and the Company's performance, 
position and prospects. This is explained in 
detail on pages 52 to 58 of the Audit 
Committee report.

Our biographies containing our relevant 
skills and experience, Board Committee 
memberships and other principal 
appointments can be found on pages 44 to 
46. Details of changes to the Board in 2019 
and year to date are disclosed on pages 48 
and 49.

The service contracts for the Executive 
Directors and the letters of appointment for 
the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are 
available for inspection at our registered office 
and at our AGM.

Induction
On appointment to the Board, all Directors 
receive a comprehensive induction that is 
tailored to the new Director's individual 
requirements. The induction schedule is 
designed to provide the new Director with 
an understanding of how the Group works 
and the key issues that it faces. The Company 
Secretary consults the Chairman when 
designing an induction schedule, giving 
consideration to the particular needs of the 
new Director. When a Director is joining a 
Board Committee, the schedule includes an 
induction to the operation of that committee.

Following their appointment, Dawn 
Fitzpatrick, Mohamed A. El-Erian and Brian 
Gilvary are receiving such an induction. They 
have met or will meet with the Company 
Secretary, the current Non-Executive 
Directors, members of the ExCo and certain 
other senior executives, as part of 
that process.

Training and development
In order to continue to contribute effectively 
to Board and Board Committee meetings, 
Directors are regularly provided with the 
opportunity to take part in ongoing training 
and development and can also request 
specific training as required. In 2019, Directors 
received ongoing training in relation to legal 
and regulatory developments in the form of 
regular briefings and the Board has enhanced 
this proposition with bi-annual training 
sessions intended to deepen and broaden the 
Board's understanding in some of the more 
complex and technical areas of the business. 
Each of these training events typically 
comprises four topics.

Changes in internal control 
over financial reporting
There have been no changes that occurred 
during the period covered by this report, 
which have materially affected or are 
reasonably likely to materially affect the 
Group's internal control over financial 
reporting.

Remuneration
The Company has a Remuneration 
Committee, the purpose and activities of 
which are described in the Remuneration 
Committee reports on pages 85 to 123.

The Board has delegated responsibility 
for the consideration and approval of 
the remuneration arrangements of the 
Chairman, the Executive Directors, other 
senior executives and certain Group 
employees to the Remuneration Committee. 
The Remuneration Committee, when 
considering the remuneration policies and 
practices, seek to ensure that they support the 
Company's strategy and promote the 
long-term success of the business and that 
they are aligned to the successful delivery of 
the Group's strategy. All executive and senior 
management remuneration policies are 
developed in accordance with the Group's 
formal and transparent procedures (ensuring 
that no Director is involved in deciding his/her 
own remuneration outcome) and having 
regard to workforce remuneration and related 
policies and the alignment of incentives and 
rewards with culture. All Remuneration 
Committee members demonstrate 
independent judgement and discretion when 
determining and approving remuneration 
outcomes. The Board as a whole, with the 
Non-Executive Directors abstaining, considers 
annually the fees paid to Non-Executive 
Directors. Information on the activities of 
the Remuneration Committee in 2019 can 
be found in the Remuneration Report on 
pages 85 to 123.

Management's report on internal 
control over financial reporting
Management is responsible for establishing 
and maintaining adequate internal control 
over financial reporting under the supervision 
of the principal executive and financial 
officers, to provide reasonable assurance 
regarding the reliability of financial reporting 
and the preparation of financial statements, 
in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS). Internal control 
over financial reporting includes policies and 
procedures that pertain to the maintenance 
of records that, in reasonable detail:

■■ accurately and fairly reflect transactions 
and dispositions of assets

■■ provide reasonable assurances that 
transactions are recorded as necessary to 
permit preparation of financial statements 
in accordance with IFRS and that receipts 
and expenditures are being made only in 
accordance with authorisations of 
management and the respective Directors

■■ provide reasonable assurance regarding 
prevention or timely detection of 
unauthorised acquisition, use or disposition 
of assets that could have a material effect 
on the financial statements.

Internal control systems, no matter how well 
designed, have inherent limitations and may 
not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, 
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness 
to future periods are subject to the risk that 
internal controls may become inadequate 
because of changes in conditions, or that 
the degree of compliance with the policies 
or procedures may deteriorate.

Management has assessed the internal 
control over financial reporting as of 
31 December 2019. In making its assessment, 
management utilised the criteria set out in the 
2013 COSO framework and concluded that, 
based on its assessment, the internal control 
over financial reporting was effective as of 
31 December 2019.

The system of internal financial and 
operational controls is also subject to 
regulatory oversight in the UK and overseas. 
Further information on supervision by the 
financial services regulators is provided under 
Supervision and Regulation in the Risk review 
section on pages 204 to 210.

Effectiveness of internal controls
Key controls are assessed on a regular basis 
for both design and operating effectiveness. 
Issues arising out of these assessments, 
where appropriate, are reported to the Audit 
Committee. You can read more about the 
work of the Audit Committee on pages 52 
to 60.

The Audit Committee also reviews annually 
the risk management and internal control 
system, which includes the ERMF. It has 
concluded that, throughout the year ended 
31 December 2019 and to date, the Group 
has operated a sound system of internal 
control that provides reasonable assurance 
of financial and operational controls and 
compliance with laws and regulations. For 
more details on that evaluation and its 
conclusions please see pages 52 to 60.

The review of the effectiveness of the system 
of risk management and internal control is 
achieved through reviewing the effectiveness 
of the frameworks, principles and processes 
contained within The Barclays Guide, the 
ERMF and the Barclays Control Framework.

Regular reports are made to the Risk 
Committee and the Board covering significant 
risks, measurement methodologies and 
appropriate risk appetite for the Group. 
The Audit Committee oversees the control 
environment (and remediation of related 
issues), and assesses the adequacy of 
credit impairment. Further details of risk 
management procedures and potential risk 
factors are given in the Risk review and risk 
management sections on pages 125 to 203.

Controls over financial reporting
A framework of disclosure controls and 
procedures is in place to support the approval 
of the financial statements of the Group. 
Specific governance committees are 
responsible for examining the financial reports 
and disclosures to ensure that they have been 
subject to adequate verification and comply 
with applicable standards and legislation.

These committees report their conclusions 
to the Audit Committee, which debates its 
conclusions and provides further challenge. 
Finally, the Board scrutinises and approves 
results announcements and the Annual 
Report, and ensures that appropriate 
disclosures have been made. This governance 
process ensures that both management and 
the Board are given sufficient opportunity to 
debate and challenge the financial statements 
of the Group and other significant disclosures 
before they are made public.

Section 414A of the Companies Act 2006 
requires the Directors to present a Strategic 
Report in the Annual Report. The information 
can be found on pages 1 to 43. 

The Company has chosen, in accordance with 
section 414C(11) of the Companies Act 2006, 
and as noted in this Directors' Report, to 
include certain matters in its Strategic Report 
that would otherwise be disclosed in this 
Directors' Report.

An indication of likely future developments 
may be found in the Strategic Report.

The particulars of important events affecting 
the Group since the financial year-end can be 
found in the Strategic Report and Note 26, 
Legal, competition and regulatory matters.

Profit and dividends 
Statutory profit after tax for 2019 was 
£3,354m (2018: £2,583m). The 2019 full year 
dividend of 6.0p per share will be paid on 
3 April 2020 to shareholders whose names are 
on the Register of Members at the close of 
business on 28 February 2020. With the 2019 
half year dividend totalling 3.0p per ordinary 
share, paid in September 2019, the total 
distribution for 2019 is 9.0p (2018: 6.5p) per 
ordinary share. The half year and full year 
dividends for 2019 amounted to £1,201m 
(2018: £768m).

Shareholders may have their dividends 
reinvested in Barclays by joining the 
Barclays PLC Scrip Dividend Programme 
(the Programme). The Programme enables 
shareholders, if they wish, to receive new 
fully-paid ordinary shares in Barclays PLC 
instead of a cash dividend, without incurring 
dealing costs or stamp duty.

The nominee company of certain Barclays' 
employee benefit trusts holding shares in 
Barclays in connection with the operation 
of the Group's share plans has lodged 
evergreen dividend waivers on shares held by 
it that have not been allocated to employees. 
The total amount of dividends waived during 
the year ended 31 December 2019 was 
£1.58m (2018: £0.85m).

The Company understands the importance 
of delivering attractive cash returns to 
shareholders. The Company is therefore 
committed to maintaining an appropriate 
balance between total cash returns to 
shareholders, investment in the business, and 
maintaining a strong capital position. Going 
forward, the Company intends to pay a 
progressive ordinary dividend taking into 
account these objectives, and the earnings 
outlook of the Group. It is also the Board's 
intention to supplement the ordinary 
dividends with additional cash returns, 
including share buy-backs, to shareholders 
as and when appropriate.

The Board notes that in determining any 
proposed distributions to shareholders, 
the Board will consider the expectation 
of servicing more senior securities.

The names of the current Directors of 
Barclays PLC, along with their biographical 
details, are set out on pages 44 to 46 and are

Appointment and  
retirement of Directors 
The appointment and retirement of Directors 
is governed by the Company's Articles of 
Association, the Code, the Companies Act 
2006 and related legislation.

The Articles may only be amended by a 
special resolution of the shareholders. The 
Board has the power to appoint additional 
Directors or to fill a casual vacancy amongst 
the Directors. Any such Director holds office 
only until the next AGM and may offer 
himself/herself for re-election. Consistent 
with the recommendation in the Code, all 
Directors will stand for election or re-election 
at the 2020 AGM.

Directors' indemnities 
Qualifying third party indemnity provisions 
(as defined by section 234 of the Companies 
Act 2006) were in force during the course of 
the financial year ended 31 December 2019 
for the benefit of the then Directors and, at the 
date of this report, are in force for the benefit 
of the Directors in relation to certain losses 
and liabilities which they may incur (or have 
incurred) in connection with their duties, 
powers or office. In addition, the Group 
maintains Directors' & Officers' Liability 
Insurance which gives appropriate cover 
for legal action brought against its Directors.

Qualifying pension scheme indemnity 
provisions (as defined by section 235 of the 
Companies Act 2006) were in force during 
the course of the financial year ended 
31 December 2019 for the benefit of the then 
Directors, and at the date of this report are 
in force for the benefit of directors of Barclays 
Pension Funds Trustees Limited as Trustee 
of the Barclays Bank UK Retirement Fund. 
The directors of the Trustee are indemnified 
against liability incurred in connection with 
that company's activities as Trustee of the 
Barclays Bank UK Retirement Fund.

Similarly, qualifying pension scheme 
indemnities were in force during 2019 for 
the benefit of directors of Barclays Capital 
International Pension Scheme (No.1), and 
Barclays PLC Funded Unapproved Retirement 
Benefits Scheme. The directors of the Trustee 
are indemnified against liability incurred in 
connection with that company's activities 
as Trustee of the schemes above.

Political donations 
The Group did not give any money for political 
purposes in the UK, the rest of the EU or 
outside of the EU, nor did it make any political 
donations to political parties or other political 
organisations, or to any independent election 
candidates, or incur any political expenditure 
during the year.

In accordance with the US Federal Election 
Campaign Act, Barclays provides 
administrative support to a federal Political 
Action Committee (PAC) in the US funded by 
the voluntary political contributions of eligible 
employees. The PAC is not controlled by 
Barclays and all decisions regarding the 
amounts and recipients of contributions are 
directed by a steering committee comprising 
employees eligible to contribute to the PAC. 
Contributions to political organisations 
reported by the PAC during the calendar year 
2019 totalled $46,000 (2018: $140,000).

Country-by-Country reporting
The Capital Requirements (Country-by-
Country reporting) Regulations 2013 
require the Company to publish additional 
information in respect of the year ended 
31 December 2019. This information is 
available on the Barclays website: 
home.barclays/annualreport.

Environment 
Banks have a direct environmental and social 
impact through their operational footprint, as 
well as indirectly in the way that they mobilise 
capital, advise clients and develop products. 
Our aim is to help facilitate the transition 
to less carbon intensive sources of energy, 
while supporting economic development and 
growth in society by helping to ensure the 
world's energy needs are met responsibly.

Barclays invests in improving the energy 
efficiency of our operational footprint and 
offsets the emissions remaining through the 
purchase of carbon credits. In 2019, we set 
an 80% reduction target from our combined 
scope 1&2 emissions aligned to Science Based 
Target methodology by 2025, and committed 
to procure 100% renewable electricity for all 
operational needs by 2030 with an interim 
goal of 90% by 2025. At the end of 2019 we 
have achieved a 53% emissions reduction and 
are currently procuring 60% of our electricity 
through renewable means. We also have a 
long-standing commitment to managing the 
environmental and social risks associated with 
our lending practices, which is embedded into 
our risk processes. A governance structure is 
in place to facilitate clear dialogue across the 
business and with suppliers around issues of 
potential environmental and social risk.

We have disclosed global greenhouse gas 
emissions (GHG) that we are responsible 
for as set out by the Companies Act 2006 
(Strategic Report and Directors' Report) 
Regulations 2013. We will provide additional 
disclosure on (i) financing solutions for the 
lower carbon economy, (ii) environmental risk 
management and (iii) management of our 
carbon and environmental footprint in the 
Strategic report as set out on page 35 
and in Barclays ESG Report which will 
be available on our website at 
home.barclays/annualreport in March 2020.

Notes
a  The carbon reporting year for our GHG emissions is 1 October to 30 September. The carbon reporting year is not fully aligned to the financial reporting year covered by the Directors' 

report. Details of our approach to assurance over the data will be included in the 2019 Barclays ESG report due be released in March 2020.
b  The methodology used to calculate our GHG is the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard Revised Edition, defined by the World Resources 

Institute/World Business Council for Sustainable Development (ERI/WBCSD). We have adopted the operational control approach on reporting boundaries to define our reporting 
boundary. Where properties are covered by Barclays' consolidated financial statements but are leased to tenants, these emissions are not included in the Group GHG calculations. 
Where Barclays is responsible for the utility costs, these emissions are included. We continuously review and update our performance data based on updated carbon emission 
factors, improvements in data quality and updates to estimates previously applied. For 2019 we have applied the latest emission factors available at the time of reporting. Where our 
performance has changed by more than 1% we have restated the balances and baseline. 2018 emissions have been updated to reflect additional consumption data which was not 
available at the time of reporting. The previously reported figure was 292,151 tCO2e.

c  Scope 1 covers direct combustion of fuels and company owned vehicles (from UK only, which is the most material contributor). Fugitive emissions reported in Scope 1 cover 
emissions from UK, Americas, Asia Pacific, India and Europe. 

d  Scope 2 covers emissions from electricity and steam purchased for own use. Market-based emissions have been reported for 2018 and 2019. We have used a zero emission factor 
where we have renewable contracts already in place in the UK, US and Continental Europe. 

e  Scope 3 covers indirect emissions from business travel (global flights and ground transport from the UK, USA and India. USA and India ground transport covers onwards car hire only 
which has been provided directly by the supplier). Ground transportation data (excluding Scope 1 company cars) covers only countries where robust data is available directly from 
the supplier.

f  Intensity ratio calculations have been calculated using location-based emission factors only.
g  Energy consumption data is captured through utility billing; meter reads or estimates. In 2019, we have reduced our energy consumption by 1.8% versus 2018. We continue to work 

on improving the operational efficiency of our property portfolio and in 2019 conducted a number of projects globally which have achieved a total energy reduction of 2GWH's since 
implementation, enough energy to boil 13 million kettles. In 2019 we have conducted a number of LED installations across our sites in the USA, India and in the UK, saving 490 MWh. 
We also saved 180 MWh of electricity globally through our switch off campaign as part of Earth Hour 2019. Across a number of our large buildings we have conducted improvements 
to the building management systems to ensure efficient plant run times and aligning heating and air conditioning to the occupancy of our buildings, saving 1,300 MWh. Globally, we 
have conducted end of life asset replacement installing more energy efficient plants in our buildings and achieving a 200MWh saving. Finally, we have continued with Server 
Decommissioning in the UK and completed cold aisle containment as well as LED lighting retrofits at our Cranford data centre in the USA saving circa 260MWh.

Research and development 
In the ordinary course of business, the Group 
develops new products and services in each 
of its business divisions.

Share capital 
Share capital structure
The Company has ordinary shares in issue. 
The Articles also allow for the issuance of 
sterling, US dollar, euro and yen preference 
shares (preference shares). No preference 
shares have been issued as at 11 February 
2020 (the latest practicable date for inclusion 
in this report). Ordinary shares therefore 
represent 100% of the total issued share 
capital as at 31 December 2019 and as at 
11 February 2020 (the latest practicable date 
for inclusion in this report).

Details of the movement in ordinary share 
capital during the year can be found in 
Note 28 on page 309.

Voting
Every member who is present in person or 
represented at any general meeting of the 
Company, and who is entitled to vote, has one 
vote on a show of hands. Every proxy present 
has one vote. The proxy will have one vote for 
and one vote against a resolution if he/she 
has been instructed to vote for or against the 
resolution by different members or in one 
direction by a member while another member 
has permitted the proxy discretion as to how 
to vote. 

On a poll, every member who is present or 
represented and who is entitled to vote has 
one vote for every share held. In the case of 
joint holders, only the vote of the senior holder 
(as determined by order in the share register) 
or his/her proxy may be counted. If any sum 
payable remains unpaid in relation to a 
member's shareholding, that member is not 
entitled to vote that share or exercise any other 
right in relation to a meeting of the Company 
unless the Board otherwise determines.

If any member, or any other person appearing 
to be interested in any of the Company's 
ordinary shares, is served with a notice under 
section 793 of the Companies Act 2006 and 
does not supply the Company with the 
information required in the notice, then the 
Board, in its absolute discretion, may direct 
that member shall not be entitled to attend or 
vote at any meeting of the Company. The 
Board may further direct that if the shares of 
the defaulting member represent 0.25% 
or more of the issued shares of the relevant 
class, that dividends or other monies payable 
on those shares shall be retained by the 
Company until the direction ceases to have 
effect and that no transfer of those shares 
shall be registered (other than certain 
specified ‘excepted transfers'). A direction 
ceases to have effect seven days after the 
Company has received the information 
requested, or when the Company is notified 
that an excepted transfer of all of the relevant 
shares to a third party has occurred, or as the 
Board otherwise determines.

Transfers 
Ordinary shares may be held in either 
certificated or uncertificated form. 
Certificated ordinary shares may be 
transferred in writing in any usual or other 
form approved by the Company Secretary 
and executed by or on behalf of the transferor. 
Transfers of uncertificated ordinary shares 
must be made in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006 and CREST Regulations.

The Board is not bound to register a transfer of 
partly-paid ordinary shares or fully-paid shares 
in exceptional circumstances approved by the 
FCA. The Board may also decline to register an 
instrument of transfer of certificated ordinary 
shares unless it is (i) duly stamped, deposited 
at the prescribed place and accompanied by 
the share certificate(s) and such other 
evidence as reasonably required by the Board 
to evidence right to transfer, (ii) it is in respect 
of one class of shares only, and (iii) it is in 
favour of a single transferee or not more than 
four joint transferees (except in the case of 
executors or trustees of a member). 

In accordance with the provisions of section 
84 of the Small Business, Enterprise and 
Employment Act 2015, preference shares may 
only be issued in registered form. Preference 
shares shall be transferred in writing in any 
usual or other form approved by the Company 
Secretary and executed by or on behalf of the 
transferor. The Company's registrar shall 
register such transfers of preference shares by 
making the appropriate entries in the register 
of preference shares. Each preference share 
shall confer, in the event of a winding up or 
any return of capital (other than, unless 
otherwise provided by their terms of issue, 
a redemption or purchase by the Company 
of any of its issued shares, or a reduction of 
share capital), the right to receive out of the 
surplus assets of the Company available for 
distribution, and in priority to the holders 
of the ordinary shares and any other lower 
ranking shares in the Company, and pari passu 
with any other class of preference shares of 
similar ranking, repayment of the amount 
paid up or treated as paid up in respect of 
the nominal value of the preference share 
together with any premium which was paid 
or treated as paid when the preference share 
was issued in addition to an amount equal to 
accrued and unpaid dividends.

Variation of rights 
The rights attached to any class of shares may 
be varied either with the consent in writing of 
the holders of at least 75% in nominal value 
of the issued shares of that class, or with the 
sanction of a special resolution passed at a 
separate meeting of the holders of the shares 
of that class. The rights of shares shall not 
(unless expressly provided by the rights 
attached to such shares) be deemed varied by 
the creation of further shares ranking equally 
with them or subsequent to them.

Limitations on foreign shareholders 
There are no restrictions imposed by the 
Articles or (subject to the effect of any 
economic sanctions that may be in force from 
time to time) by current UK laws which relate 
only to non-residents of the UK and which 
limit the rights of such non-residents to 
hold or (when entitled to do so) vote the 
ordinary shares.

Exercisability of rights under 
an employee share scheme 
Employee Benefit Trusts (EBTs) operate 
in connection with certain of the Group's 
Employee Share Plans (Plans). The trustees of 
the EBTs may exercise all rights attached to 
the shares in accordance with their fiduciary 
duties other than as specifically restricted 
in the relevant Plan governing documents. 
The trustees of the EBTs have informed the 
Company that their normal policy is to abstain 
from voting in respect of the Barclays shares 
held in trust. The trustees of the Global 
Sharepurchase EBT and UK Sharepurchase 
EBTs may vote in respect of Barclays shares 
held in the EBTs, but only as instructed by 
participants in those Plans in respect of 
their partnership shares and (when vested) 
matching and dividend shares. The trustees 
will not otherwise vote in respect of shares 
held in the Sharepurchase EBTs. 

Special rights
There are no persons holding securities that 
carry special rights with regard to the control 
of the Company. 

Major shareholders
Major shareholders do not have different 
voting rights from those of other shareholders. 
Information provided to the Company by 
substantial shareholders pursuant to the FCA's 
Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules 
are published via a Regulatory Information 
Service and is available on the Company's 
website. As at 31 December 2019, the 
Company had been notified under Rule 5 of 
the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency 
Rules of the following holdings of voting 
rights in its shares.

2020 (the latest practicable date for inclusion 
in this report), the Company was notified that 
Capital Group Companies Inc, now holds 
863,929,297 Barclays shares, representing 
4.99% of the total voting right attached to 
the shares and that Norges Bank now holds 
525,031,736 Barclays shares, representing 
3.03% of the total voting rights attached to 
the shares.

Powers of Directors to issue or 
buy back the Company's shares
The powers of the Directors are determined 
by the Companies Act 2006 and the Articles. 
The Directors are authorised to issue and 
allot shares and to buy back shares subject 
to annual shareholder approval at the AGM. 
Such authorities were granted by shareholders 
at the 2019 AGM. It will be proposed at the 
2020 AGM that the Directors be granted new 
authorities to allot and buy back shares.

Repurchase of shares
The Company did not repurchase any of its 
ordinary shares during 2019 (2018: none). 
As at 11 February 2020 (the latest practicable 
date for inclusion in this report) the Company 
had an unexpired authority to repurchase 
ordinary shares up to a maximum of 1,714m 
ordinary shares. 

Distributable reserves
As at 31 December 2019, the distributable 
reserves of Barclays PLC were £22,457m.

Change of control
There are no significant agreements to which 
the Company is a party that are affected by 
a change of control of the Company following 
a takeover bid. There are no agreements 
between the Company and its Directors or 
employees providing for compensation for 
loss of office or employment that occurs 
because of a takeover bid.

Disclosure of information 
to the Auditor 
Each Director confirms that, so far as he/she 
is aware, there is no relevant audit information 
of which the Company's auditors are unaware 
and that each of the Directors has taken all 
the steps that he/she ought to have taken as 
a Director to make himself/herself aware of 
any relevant audit information and to establish 
that the Company's auditors are aware of that 
information. This confirmation is given 
pursuant to section 418 of the Companies Act 
2006 and should be interpreted in accordance 
with and subject to those provisions.

Directors' responsibilities 
The following statement, which should be 
read in conjunction with the Auditors' report 
set out on page 232 to 240, is made with a 
view to distinguishing for shareholders the 
respective responsibilities of the Directors 
and of the auditors in relation to the accounts. 

Going concern 
The Group's business activities, financial 
position, capital, factors likely to affect its 
future development and performance and its 
objectives and policies in managing the 
financial risks to which it is exposed are 
discussed in the Strategic Report and Risk 
Review and Risk Management sections.

The Directors considered it appropriate to 
prepare the financial statements on a going 
concern basis.

In preparing each of the Group and Company 
financial statements, the Directors are 
required to:

■■ assess the Group and Company's ability 
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, 
as applicable, matters related to going 
concern

■■ use the going concern basis of accounting 
unless they either intend to liquidate the 
Group or the Company or to cease 
operations, or have no realistic alternative 
but to do so.

Preparation of accounts
The Directors are required by the Companies 
Act 2006 to prepare Group and Company 
accounts for each financial year and, with 
regards to Group accounts, in accordance 
with Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. The 
Directors have prepared Group and Company 
accounts in accordance with IFRS as adopted 
by the EU. Under the Companies Act 2006, 
the Directors must not approve the accounts 
unless they are satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Group and the Company and of their profit 
or loss for that period.

The Directors consider that, in preparing 
the financial statements the Group and the 
Company have used appropriate accounting 
policies, supported by reasonable judgements 
and estimates, and that all accounting 
standards which they consider to be 
applicable have been followed.

The Directors are satisfied that the Annual 
Report and Financial Statements, taken as a 
whole, are fair, balanced and understandable, 
and provide the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group and the 
Company's position and performance, 
business model and strategy.

Directors are responsible for such internal 
control as they determine is necessary to 
enable the preparation of financial statements 
that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.

Directors' responsibility statement 
The Directors have responsibility for ensuring 
that the Company and the Group keep 
accounting records which disclose with 
reasonable accuracy the financial position 
of the Company and the Group and which 
enable them to ensure that the accounts 
comply with the Companies Act 2006.

The Directors are also responsible for 
preparing a Strategic Report, Directors' Report, 
Directors' Remuneration Report and Corporate 
Governance Statement in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. 

The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the Annual 
Report and Financial Statements as they 
appear on the Company's website. Legislation 
in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

The Directors have a general responsibility for 
taking such steps as are reasonably open to 
them to safeguard the assets of the Group 
and to prevent and detect fraud and other 
irregularities.

The Directors, whose names and functions are 
set out on pages 44 to 46, confirm to the best 
of their knowledge that:

(a)  the financial statements, prepared in 
accordance with the applicable set of 
accounting standards, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit or loss of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and

(b)  the management report, on pages 6 to 42, 
which is incorporated in the Directors' 
Report, includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the 
business and the position of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, together 
with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that they face.

Dear Fellow Shareholders
I am pleased to present the Directors' 
Remuneration Report for 2019. The 
Committee has had many important matters 
to consider during the year. Barclays' Fair Pay 
agenda continues to play an important role in 
guiding the Committee in its decision-making, 
and we are proud to publish our second Fair 
Pay Report. We are also publishing a separate 
Pay Gaps Report, so that our pay gaps are 
explained as clearly as possible.

As part of this report we are introducing 
our new Directors' remuneration policy (DRP) 
for shareholders to consider as part of voting 
at the 2020 Annual General Meeting (AGM) 
in May. The current DRP was approved 
by shareholders in 2017. A summary of the 
changes proposed is included in this 
statement, and the full policy is detailed 
on pages 93 to 103 of this report. 

We also met with multiple shareholders 
following the voting outcome on the 
Directors' Remuneration Report (Resolution 2) 
at the 2019 AGM. The engagement was 
constructive, and helped to clarify the reasons 
for the outcome of the vote. Following the 
engagement, we published a statement 
setting out our response to the voting 
outcome. The statement is set out on page 
121.

Our stakeholders
One of the key principles of our remuneration 
philosophy is that stakeholder views are 
considered when we design remuneration 
policies and determine pay outcomes. In 
practice, this means listening to and engaging 
with our stakeholders, including our 
shareholders, employees and regulators, as 
well as considering broader societal factors.

Our Fair Pay agenda helps us to engage with 
different stakeholders on pay. Key highlights 
for 2019 include the agreement of a new 
one-year pay deal with Unite, with an above 
inflation budget of 2.75%, and with higher 
increases for the most junior entry grades. We 
have also started to expand globally our UK 
living wage commitment by working with the 
Fair Wage Network. Separately, the Committee 
has focused on reviewing wider workforce 
policies as well as their pay outcomes in more 
detail. We have a strong partnership with 
Unite in the UK, and actively engage with 
Works Councils in other locations.

We discussed our new plans for the DRP with 
major shareholders. The discussions were 
informative and productive, and we thank our 
shareholders for their willingness to engage. 
The main change, aligned with our Fair Pay 
agenda, is a reduction in pension allowance 
for the Executive Directors. This voluntary 
change by the Executive Directors is set out 
in more detail on page 88. 

While we have considered alternative variable 
pay structures for the Executive Directors, we 
cannot see a superior acceptable approach 
and so have decided to retain the existing 
structure. We will keep this under review as 
market practice develops.

Annual statement from the Chairman 
of the Board Remuneration Committee

REMUNERATION REPORT

Fair Pay and  
Pay Gaps Reports
We have continued to evolve our 
Fair Pay agenda during 2019, and 
are pleased to publish our second 
Fair Pay Report, reporting our 
progress against our five themes.

This year we have also published a 
Pay Gaps Report, including both our 
Gender Pay Gap results and our 
Ethnicity Pay Gap disclosure, which 
we are making for the second year 
on a voluntary basis.

REMUNERATION REPORT

Using the framework, the annual bonus 
outcomes for Jes Staley and Tushar Morzaria 
were 83.3% and 84.3% of maximum 
respectively. The Committee considered these 
outcomes in the context of pay outcomes for 
the wider workforce for 2019. 

As part of its deliberations, the Committee 
noted that the outcomes for the Executive 
Directors were increasing at a time when the 
overall incentive pool was decreasing. While 
recognising that this is not an unusual 
outcome given the structured formulaic 
approach applied to Executive Directors' 
incentives (e.g. in 2018, Executive Directors' 
outcomes were down slightly, while the overall 
incentive pool was up), the Committee 
determined that for 2019 it would be 
appropriate to apply a discretionary reduction 
to the formulaic Executive Directors' outcome 
in line with the broader pool reduction. 
Applying the 10% discretionary reduction 
results in a bonus outcome of 75.0% for Jes 
Staley and 75.9% for Tushar Morzaria.

Separately, the Committee decided to make an 
award under the 2020-2022 Long Term 
Incentive Plan (LTIP) cycle to both Executive 
Directors with a face value at grant of 120% of 
Total fixed pay, reflective of the strong 2019 
performance.

The outcome of the 2017-2019 LTIP, which is 
due to vest in June 2020, is set out on pages 
109 to 111. 

Looking ahead
We will continue to focus on our Fair Pay 
agenda during 2020, including reviewing 
living wages for locations outside of the UK, 
US and India. We will also look to further our 
work on pay simplification, and will continue 
to engage with our shareholders and other 
stakeholders on pay.

Chairman,  
Board Remuneration Committee

Performance and pay
Rewarding sustainable performance is a 
crucial aspect of our remuneration philosophy 
and so the Committee spent considerable 
time understanding performance. While it was 
another challenging year with global 
macroeconomic and political uncertainties at 
play, profit before tax excluding litigation and 
conduct (PBT) is up 9% from 2018. Group 
return on tangible equity excluding litigation 
and conduct (RoTE) is 9.0%, in line with our 
target for 2019, and costs are also in line with 
our 2019 guidance of less than £13.6bn. Our 
capital position is strong, with a CET1 ratio of 
13.8%. The Committee recognises that 
significant progress on financial performance 
has now been achieved over a sustained 
period. 

Non-financial performance has also been 
strong. Customer and client outcomes are 
positive, with improvements in Net Promoter 
Score® (NPS) for Barclays UK and Barclaycard, 
and an increase in the take-up of mobile 
banking. Complaints in Barclays UK are down 
8% from 2018, though we recognise we need 
to go further and faster. Our employee 
engagement survey score is down slightly on 
2018, driven by various factors including the 
tools and resources available to employees. 
This is already an area of management focus 
and investment for the Group. Considering our 
broader impact on society, global carbon 
emissions are down by 53%, and we have 
helped over 2 million people improve their 
employability skills through LifeSkills.

Over the years, we have considered the 
appropriate balance between returns to 
shareholders and rewarding employees. This 
year, the Committee has approved an 
incentive pool of £1,490m, down 10% from 
2018. After much deliberation, we feel that 
this outcome strikes the right balance 
between our shareholders and our employees, 
enabling us to further improve returns to our 
shareholders while also maintaining a 
competitive pay opportunity for our wider 
workforce.

Executive Director 
remuneration outcomes
The annual incentive outcomes for Jes Staley 
and Tushar Morzaria are assessed with 
reference to a set framework against 
pre-determined financial, strategic and 
personal measures and objectives. For 2019, 
performance against the financial objectives 
(representing 60% of the overall measures) 
has been very strong, with targets exceeded. 
Strategic and personal performance has also 
been strong – full details of this assessment 
are set out on pages 104 to 109.

REMUNERATION REPORT

Directors' remuneration policy
Barclays' policy on remuneration for the Directors was last reviewed in 2016, and approved by 97.91% of the shareholder vote at the  
May 2017 AGM.

Overall, the current DRP has served its purpose, enabling the Committee to deploy remuneration in a manner consistent with our philosophy, 
while recognising that the Committee is unable to change some aspects of the policy (e.g. because of regulatory requirements).

The review of the DRP by the Committee has provided an opportunity to consider the policy against the Fair Pay agenda and the most recent 
guidance from shareholders and proxy agencies. 

Following engagement with major shareholders, the Investment Association, ISS and Glass Lewis, the key changes proposed are set out below.

 Please see page 93 for the full 
Directors' remuneration policy.



Annual statement:  
Key changes to the DRP

What are the key changes to the DRP?

Key changes

Fixed Pay In line with the approach outlined at the start of the last DRP, the Committee has reviewed its approach to Fixed Pay for the 
Executive Directors. Consequently, having taken into account a number of factors, the following Fixed Pay increases are 
proposed:

CEO: An increase of 2.1%, resulting in proposed Fixed Pay of £2,400,000.

Jes Staley joined Barclays in December 2015, and this is the first Fixed Pay increase proposed since that time. His increase 
is below the average increase for UK employees, for the 2019/20 annual pay review.

Group Finance Director (GFD): An increase of 4.5%, resulting in proposed Fixed Pay of £1,725,000.

Since the last DRP, Tushar Morzaria has taken on additional responsibilities as a result of our new legal entity structure. 
He oversees additional complexities associated with capital management and financial reporting post ring-fencing and 
the establishment of the US Intermediate Holding Company. In addition, he has taken accountability for Group Strategy. 
This is the first increase for Tushar Morzaria proposed since the last DRP was approved in 2017.

We will continue to deliver Fixed Pay 50% in cash and 50% in shares (delivered quarterly and subject to a holding period 
with restrictions lifting over a period of five years). Going forward, it is intended that Fixed Pay for the Executive Directors 
is reviewed annually, to align with the employee review cycle, and enhance transparency.

Wider workforce context
The average annual increase for Fixed Pay for UK employees is 2.7%, with differentiation within that based on a number 
of factors. We agreed a one-year pay deal with Unite, covering c.45,000 UK employees at junior and middle management 
levels with a Fixed Pay increase budget of 2.75%. Over the term of the prior DRP, the average cumulative increase provided 
to the UK wider workforce was 10%.

Pension In our new policy, our Executive Directors have volunteered to reduce their contractual pension allowance to 5% of Fixed 
Pay (equivalent to 10% of Fixed cash) – a decrease of £276,000 for the CEO and a decrease of £113,750 for the GFD.

Wider workforce context
For comparison, we operate two pension plans in the UK: Afterwork, a contributory legacy cash balance defined benefit 
plan (effective employer contribution cost of 21.2% of salary), and the Barclays Pension Savings Plan, a defined 
contribution plan for new joiners (current employer contribution rate of 10% of salary).

The Committee also reviewed the pension arrangements for the wider workforce. The outcome of this review was 
to change the employer contribution rate from 10% to 12% for our most junior employees (c.17,500 employees). This will 
be implemented during 2020.

In addition, the following actions have already been taken to further improve pensionable pay. 

■■ We have rolled all fixed and permanent allowances into pensionable pay.
■■ In BUK, we have transferred a material portion of bonus opportunity into salary for customer-facing staff 

(c.19,500 employees), further increasing pensionable pay. 
Our policy on pension for any new Executive Director will also be changed to align with the revised approach for existing 
Executive Directors.

What are the key changes to the DRP? continued

Key changes

Variable pay Going forward we will express the variable pay opportunity as a proportion of Fixed Pay, excluding pension.
This presentational change is required as variable pay opportunity is currently presented as a multiple of Total fixed pay 
(i.e. Fixed Pay and pension). This approach was initially adopted to clearly demonstrate compliance with the regulatory 2:1 
regime (which classifies pension as fixed remuneration for 2:1 purposes). Without making this change, there would be an 
unintended reduction in the maximum variable pay opportunity for the Executive Directors.

This new way of expressing the variable pay opportunity does not affect regulatory compliance.

The maximum variable pay opportunity will therefore be 233% of Fixed Pay for the CEO and 224% for the GFD. The 
apportionment between annual bonus and LTIP (currently 40:60) will be maintained, resulting in a maximum annual 
bonus opportunity of 93% for the CEO and 90% for the GFD and a maximum LTIP opportunity of 140% and 134% 
respectively.

The diagrams below illustrate the maintenance of the variable pay opportunity based on the current level of Fixed Pay.

Shareholding 
requirements

In line with best practice guidance, post-termination shareholding requirements will be increased to align with 
requirements during employment. Unvested shares (net of tax) may contribute to meeting this post-termination 
requirement provided that there are no outstanding performance conditions.

Shareholding requirements during employment remain unchanged, although going forward we will express them as a 
proportion of Fixed Pay only, in line with our approach to variable pay. This also ensures that our shareholding 
requirements are not reduced because of the change to pension allowance.

The requirement during employment will therefore be: 233% of Fixed Pay for the CEO and 224% of Fixed Pay for the GFD.

REMUNERATION REPORT

Group-wide remuneration philosophy

Remuneration philosophy
While ‘fairness' has been a consideration and focus when making pay decisions at Barclays for many years, we reported on our approach to pay 
fairness for the first time in 2018, when we published our Fair Pay agenda as part of the 2017 Annual Report. Given the importance of our Fair Pay 
agenda, we have now formally included ‘fairness' in our remuneration philosophy. Similarly, we have incorporated our long-held view with regard 
to the need to consider the perspectives of all of our stakeholders, not just investors.

To attract and retain the people who can best deliver for our customers and clients, we must pay fairly and appropriately – balancing the interests 
of all our stakeholders. Our policies and practices reward sustainable performance in line with our values and risk expectations. They are fair, 
transparent and as simple as possible.

This is our remuneration philosophy. It's how we have continued to make remuneration decisions and set remuneration policies during 2019, and 
it applies to all of our employees globally, as well as our Executive Directors.

Barclays' remuneration philosophy

Attract and retain talent needed 
to deliver Barclays' strategy

Long-term success depends on the talent of our employees. This means attracting and 
retaining an appropriate range of talent to deliver against our strategy, and paying the right 
amount for that talent

Align pay with investor and other 
stakeholder interests

Remuneration should be designed with appropriate consideration of the views, rights and 
interests of stakeholders. This means listening to our shareholders, other investors, regulators, 
government, customers and employees and ensuring their views are appropriately considered 
in remuneration decision-making

Reward sustainable performance Sustainable performance means making a positive contribution to stakeholders, in both the 
short and longer term, playing a valuable role in society

Support Barclays' values and culture Results must be achieved in a manner consistent with our values. Our values and culture 
should drive the way that business is conducted

Align with risk appetite, risk exposure 
and conduct expectations

Designed to reward employees for achieving results in line with the Bank's risk appetite and 
conduct expectations

Be fair, transparent and as simple 
as possible

We are committed to ensuring pay is fair, simple and transparent for all our stakeholders. This 
means all employees and stakeholders should understand how we reward our employees and 
fairness should be a lens through which we make remuneration decisions

Review of wider workforce policies, practices and pay outcomes
During 2019, the Committee formalised its approach to ensuring consideration of wider workforce interests in remuneration, reviewing both 
remuneration policies, practices and pay outcomes for the wider workforce.

Wider workforce remuneration policies were reviewed against the following criteria:

■■ the remuneration philosophy
■■ Barclays' Fair Pay agenda
■■ Barclays' purpose, values, conduct expectations and supporting long-term success
■■ Executive Director and senior management remuneration policies.

The policies were found to be well-aligned with the criteria. The remuneration philosophy principles are reflected in the policies, while the themes 
of our Fair Pay agenda are embedded in our practices. Barclays' purpose, values, conduct expectations and long-term success are supported by 
our approach to performance management and remuneration. Remuneration is also adjusted to take account of risk and conduct matters.

Wider workforce policies are also well aligned with those for the Executive Directors and senior management, including the setting of Fixed Pay 
using market benchmarks and the determination and delivery of annual discretionary incentives. Where differences occur, they are based on 
policies that reflect senior management's ability to influence overall business outcomes (e.g. greater portion of pay delivered through variable pay) 
and align senior colleagues more closely with shareholders such as the delivery of some Fixed Pay in shares, delivery of a high proportion of 
incentives in shares and the use of LTIP for the Executive Directors. 

As outlined earlier, the Executive Directors have voluntarily decided to reduce their contractual pension allowance to 5% of Fixed Pay (equivalent 
to 10% of Fixed cash).

The Committee took both top-down and bottom-up approaches to the review of pensions, agreeing to reduce the pension allowance for Executive 
Directors, and also reviewing the offering for the wider workforce. As a result, we are enhancing the employer pension contribution for c.17,500 UK 
employees, increasing from 10% to 12%, as outlined on page 88.

The Committee also reviewed the 2019 remuneration outcomes for the wider workforce, in particular in comparison with senior management 
outcomes. The Committee satisfied itself that there was appropriate alignment. The Committee Chairman provides updates to the Board on these 
matters following each meeting.

Be fair, transparent and as simple as possible
Paying fairly and transparently is a key priority at Barclays and updating the Remuneration Philosophy to formalise the link to the Fair Pay agenda 
indicates our ongoing commitment to this. The Fair Pay agenda brings together the five themes which explain how we think about fair pay 
at Barclays. 

Last year we published our first standalone Fair Pay Report, which set out both our achievements and future priorities. In this year's report, 
we provide an update on our progress, and details of our next priorities. We use our Fair Pay Report to engage our employees on pay, explaining 
our approach to fair pay, including the alignment of the Executive Directors' and employee pay.

The infographic below highlights our 2019 achievements. We encourage you to read the full Fair Pay Report and a separate Pay Gaps Report, 
setting out our mandatory UK Gender Pay Gap disclosure and voluntary Ethnicity Pay Gap disclosure, which can both be found  
on home.barclays/annualreport.

Alignment of employee and  
executive remuneration

Our pay policies are strongly aligned 
across the wider workforce, senior 
employees and Executive Directors.

The Directors' Remuneration Policy has 
been refreshed taking account of wider 
workforce policies.

Equal Pay
We are explicit that pay decisions must 
not take into account gender, age, 
ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation  
or any other protected characteristic.

All grievances raised by employees, 
including any issues related to pay,  
are investigated.

Fair pay for the lowest paid
We worked with the Fair Wage Network 
to start to implement living wage 
benchmarks globally.

In 2020, the employer pension 
contribution will increase to 12% 
for c. 17,500 employees.

c21k We simplified our pay structures 
for c.21,000 employees in the UK, 
reclassifying allowances as salary and 
increasing pensionable pay.

24/7 We have made plans to provide 24/7 
access to a GP via a video or telephone 
appointment for all UK employees, 
starting later in 2020.

Equal opportunities to progress
We have invested in data analytics 
capabilities to allow leaders to track 
female representation in their business, 
in particular, the rates of hiring, promotion 
and retention.

A dedicated Pay Gaps Report covers our 
Gender Pay Gap and voluntary Ethnicity 
Pay Gap disclosure.

Parental leave and carers' policies 
externally disclosed for the first time. 

  25% Our senior leadership is now 25% female, 
up 1% from 2018, moving us closer to our 
target of 28% by the end of 2021.

Listening to employees
• We agreed a new pay deal with Unite, with a one-year 

budget increase of 2.75%, well in excess of inflation.

• We implemented the new Reward strategy in Barclays UK, 
which was designed with employee feedback in mind.

• We will check that our approach to Fair Pay is clear 
and understandable to employees, through our 
regular sentiment tracking and well-established 
engagement plans.

 “Unite is committed to 
fair pay and works in 
partnership with Barclays 
to negotiate and improve 
pay, shape policies and 
push for greater equality.”

REMUNERATION REPORT

Remuneration policy for all employees

As outlined on page 90, Barclays has a clearly articulated remuneration philosophy. This continues to drive our thinking in how we structure and 
determine remuneration for all employees from the most senior (e.g. our Executive Directors) to our new apprentices and graduates. This year we 
reviewed our remuneration policies and practices for alignment with the Directors' remuneration policy and approaches for senior management, 
the long-term success of Barclays and the Fair Pay agenda. 

We continue to ensure that we comply with all prevailing regulation. We identify individuals who may expose Barclays to material risk, and pay 
them in a way which encourages alignment of their interests and Barclays. Further information in relation to Material Risk Takers (MRTs) is set out 
in Appendix E of the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report.

The table below provides a summary of the remuneration approach for employees below the Board, alongside changes made during 2019.

Remuneration features Changes in 2019

Salary Salaries reflect individuals' skills and experience and are reviewed annually.
They are increased where justified by role change, increased responsibility 
or a change in the appropriate market rate. Salaries may also be increased 
in line with local statutory requirements and in line with union and works 
council commitments.

We have been a real living wage employer in the UK since 2013.

Across the UK, the roll-in of permanent 
allowances to salary has increased the 
pensionable salary for c.21,000 UK employees.

We have introduced a minimum wage of $15 
per hour in the US, and have engaged the Fair 
Wage Network to further expand our living 
wage coverage to India, covering 93% of our 
population globally with ‘living wage' 
initiatives.

For c.19,500 customer-facing staff in Barclays 
UK, we have rebalanced pay (more Fixed, less 
variable) meaning the amount delivered as 
pensionable salary has been further increased.

Role Based 
Pay (RBP)

A small number of senior employees (c.1% UK employees) receive a class 
of Fixed Pay called RBP to recognise the seniority, scale and complexity of 
their role. This may change where justified by role or responsibility change 
or a change in the appropriate market rate. 

No change.

Pension and 
benefits

The provision of a competitive package of benefits is important to 
attracting and retaining the talented staff needed to deliver Barclays' 
strategy. Employees have access to a range of country-specific Company- 
funded benefits, including pension schemes, health care, life assurance 
and Barclays' share plans as well as other voluntary employee funded 
benefits. The cost of providing these benefits is defined and controlled.

The employer pension contribution is set to 
increase from 10% to 12% for c.17,500 UK 
junior employees, remaining at 10% for more 
senior employees. 

Annual  
bonus 

Annual bonuses incentivise and reward the achievement of Group, 
business and individual objectives, and reward employees for 
demonstrating individual behaviours in line with Barclays' values. 
All employees are considered, subject to eligibility criteria. 

For senior employees, an appropriate proportion of their incentive amount 
is deferred to future years. Deferred bonuses are generally delivered in 
equal portions as deferred cash and shares. They are subject to either a 
three, five or seven-year deferral period (and further holding periods of six 
or 12 months for deferrals in shares) in line with regulatory requirements.

Consistent with regulation, the remuneration of MRTs is subject to the 2:1 
maximum ratio of variable to fixed remuneration.

A new reward strategy for Barclays UK has 
aligned a portion of incentives for all 
front-office Barclays UK employees, measuring 
success against the same customer-focused 
metric for all.

Share plans We encourage wider employee share ownership through the all-employee 
share plans. 

99% (2018: 98%) of the global employee 
population is eligible to participate.

Performance 
management

Performance assessment is based on ‘what' is achieved in relation to 
individual, team and business objectives, as well as ‘how' this is achieved 
in the context of Barclays' values. Both elements are assessed 
independently of each other with no requirement to have an overall rating. 
This reinforces the equal importance of the ‘what' and ‘how'.

No change.

Risk and 
conduct

Risk and conduct events are taken seriously at Barclays and the Committee 
ensures that there are in-year adjustments, malus or clawback applied to 
individual remuneration, where appropriate. 

In addition to individual adjustments, the Committee considers collective 
adjustment to the incentive pool for risk and conduct. 

For 2019, the impact of collective adjustments 
is a reduction of c.£160m.

More information on our approach to Performance Management, and Risk and Conduct are set out in Appendix E of the Barclays PLC 2019 Pillar 3 
Report, which can be found on home.barclays/annualreport.

Directors' remuneration policy
REMUNERATION REPORT

Remuneration policy – Executive Directors

Element and purpose Operation
Maximum value and 
performance measures

Fixed Pay
To reward skills and 
experience appropriate for the 
scale, complexity and 
responsibilities of the role and 
to provide the basis for a 
competitive remuneration 
package

Fixed Pay is determined based on the individual's role, skills and 
experience with reference to market practice and market data (on 
which the Committee receives independent advice).

Executive Directors' total compensation is benchmarked against 
comparable roles in the following banks: Bank of America, BNP Paribas, 
Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, JP Morgan Chase & Co, 
Lloyds, Morgan Stanley, Standard Chartered and UBS. The Committee 
may amend the list of comparator companies to ensure it remains 
relevant to Barclays or if circumstances make this necessary (for 
example, as a result of takeovers or mergers).

50% of Fixed Pay is delivered in cash (paid monthly), and 50% is 
delivered in shares. The shares are delivered quarterly and are subject 
to a holding period with restrictions lifting over five years (20% each 
year). As the Executive Directors beneficially own the shares, they will 
be entitled to any dividends paid on those shares.

Risk and conduct adjustment, malus and clawback provisions do not 
apply to Fixed Pay.

Fixed Pay for Executive Directors 
is set within the benchmark range 
determined by the Committee 
taking into account their skills, 
experience and performance. 

The Fixed Pay is £2,400,000 for 
Jes Staley (Group Chief Executive) 
and £1,725,000 for Tushar 
Morzaria (Group Finance 
Director). Increases will normally 
be aligned to the annual increase 
for UK employees, and will take 
into account changes in 
responsibilities and market 
conditions. There are no 
performance measures.

Pension
To enable Executive Directors 
to build long-term retirement 
savings

Executive Directors receive an annual cash allowance in lieu of 
participation in a pension arrangement.

Risk and conduct adjustments, malus and clawback provisions do not 
apply to pension.

The maximum annual cash 
allowance is 5% of Fixed Pay 
(equivalent to 10% of fixed cash).

There are no performance 
measures.

Benefits
To provide a competitive 
and cost-effective benefits 
package appropriate to 
the role and location

Executive Directors' benefits provision includes, but is not restricted to, 
private medical cover, annual health check, life and ill health income 
protection, and use of a Company vehicle and driver when required for 
business purposes (including any tax liabilities that may arise from this 
benefit).

Relocation: If an Executive Director were to relocate to perform their 
role, additional support would be provided for a defined and limited 
period of time in line with Barclays' general employee mobility 
policy including, but not restricted to, the provision of temporary 
accommodation, tax advice, home leave related costs, payment 
of removal costs and relocation flights for the Executive Director, 
spouse and children. Barclays will pay the Executive Director's tax 
on the relocation costs but will not tax equalise and will also not pay 
the tax on any other employment income.

The maximum value of benefits 
is determined by the nature of 
the benefit itself and costs of 
provision may depend on external 
factors, e.g. insurance costs.

This section sets out the proposed new Barclays' forward-looking remuneration policy for Directors, which has evolved from the existing policy 
and explains each element of remuneration and how it operates. The policy described in this section is intended to apply for three years 
beginning on the date of the 2020 AGM, subject to shareholder approval.

The existing policy can be found on pages 108 to 112 of the 2016 Annual Report or at home.barclays/annualreport

REMUNERATION REPORT

Directors' remuneration policy

Element and purpose Operation
Maximum value and 
performance measures

Annual bonus
To reward delivery of 
short-term financial targets 
set each year, the individual 
performance of the Executive 
Directors in achieving those 
targets, and their contribution 
to delivering Barclays' 
strategic objectives

Delivery in part in shares 
with holding period increases 
alignment with shareholders. 
Deferred bonuses 
encourage longer term 
focus and retention

Determination of annual bonus
Individual bonuses are entirely discretionary and decisions are based on 
the Committee's judgement of Executive Directors' performance in the 
year, measured against Group and personal objectives.

Delivery structure
Annual bonuses are delivered as a combination of cash and shares, 
a proportion of which may be deferred and/or subject to a 
holding period.

Deferral proportions and vesting profiles will be structured so that, 
in combination with any LTIP award, the proportion of variable pay 
that is deferred is no less than that required by regulations (currently 
60%).

Deferred bonuses are granted by the Committee (or an authorised 
sub-committee) at its discretion, subject to the relevant plan rules 
as amended from time to time.

The number of deferred bonus shares to be awarded will be based on 
a share price discounted by reference to an expected dividend yield 
over the vesting period, where dividend equivalents cannot be awarded 
due to regulations. In such circumstances, the Committee has 
discretion to reduce (not increase) the number of shares that vest 
if actual dividends paid over the period are materially lower than the 
original dividend assumption.

A notional discount may be applied to the deferred bonus awards for 
the purposes of calculating the 2:1 cap to the extent this is permitted 
by regulations (currently a discount is permitted on up to 25% of 
variable pay where the conditions for applying such a discount 
are met).

Timing of receipt
Non-deferred cash components of any bonus are paid following 
the performance year to which they relate, normally in March. 
Non-deferred share bonuses are also awarded normally in March and 
are subject to a holding period (after the payment of tax) in line with 
regulations and with release no faster than permitted by regulations 
(currently one year).

Deferred share bonuses are structured so that no deferred shares vest 
faster than permitted by regulations. Vesting is also subject to the 
provisions of the plan rules including employment and the malus and 
clawback provisions. Any shares that vest are subject to an additional 
holding period (after payment of tax) in line with regulations and with 
release no faster than permitted by regulations (currently one year).

Risk and conduct adjustment, malus and clawback provisions apply 
to any bonus awards, as set out on page 96.

The maximum annual bonus 
opportunity is 93% of Fixed Pay 
(cash and shares) for the CEO 
and 90% of Fixed Pay (cash and 
shares) for the GFD.

The Committee will consider 
the previously disclosed financial 
and non-financial (including 
risk-related measures and 
personal objectives) measures 
in determining the annual bonus 
for the Executive Directors. 
Financial factors will guide 
at least 60% of the bonus 
opportunity.

Any bonus is discretionary and 
any amount may be awarded 
from zero to the maximum value.

The Committee has the discretion 
to vary the measures and their 
respective weightings within 
each category. The measures 
and weightings will be disclosed 
annually as part of the annual 
report on Directors' 
remuneration, at the beginning 
of the performance year 
(typically February).

Maximum value and

Long Term Incentive Plan 
(LTIP) award
To incentivise execution 
of Barclays' strategy over 
a multi-year period 

Long-term performance 
measurement, deferral and 
holding periods encourage 
a long-term view and align 
Executive Directors' interests 
with those of shareholders

Malus and clawback 
provisions discourage 
excessive risk-taking and 
inappropriate behaviours

Determination of LTIP award
LTIP awards are made by the Committee following discussion of 
recommendations made by the Chairman (for the Group Chief 
Executive's LTIP award) and by the Group Chief Executive (for other 
Executive Directors' LTIP awards) based on satisfactory performance 
over the prior year.

Delivery structure
LTIP awards are granted subject to the plan rules and are satisfied in 
Barclays' shares (although they may be satisfied in other instruments 
as may be required by regulation).

LTIP awards are structured so that when combined with the annual 
bonus the proportion of variable pay that is deferred is no less than 
that required by regulations (currently 60%).

For each award, forward-looking performance measures are set 
at grant and there is no retesting allowed of those conditions. 
The Committee has, within the parameters set out across, the flexibility 
to vary the weighting of performance measures and calibration for 
each award prior to its grant.

The Committee has discretion, and in line with the plan rules approved 
by shareholders, in exceptional circumstances to amend targets, 
measures, or the number of awards if an event happens (for example, 
a major transaction) that, in the opinion of the Committee, causes 
the original targets or measures to be no longer appropriate or such 
adjustment to be reasonable. The Committee also has the discretion 
to reduce the vesting of any award, including to nil, if it deems that 
the outcome is not consistent with performance delivered.

The number of shares to be awarded will be based on a share price 
discounted by reference to an expected dividend yield over the vesting 
period, where dividend equivalents cannot be awarded due to 
regulations. In such circumstances, the Committee has discretion to 
reduce (not increase) the number of shares that vest if actual dividends 
paid over the period are materially lower than the original dividend 
assumption.

A notional discount may be applied to LTIP awards for the purposes 
of calculating the 2:1 cap to the extent this is permitted by regulations 
(currently a discount is permitted on up to 25% of variable pay where 
the conditions for applying such a discount are met).

Timing of receipt
Barclays LTIP awards are structured so that no award vests before the 
third anniversary of grant and an award vests no faster than permitted 
by regulations (currently in five equal tranches with the first tranche 
vesting on or around the third anniversary of grant and the last tranche 
vesting on or around the seventh anniversary of the grant date). 
Any shares that vest are subject to an additional holding period 
(after payment of tax) in line with regulations, with restrictions lifting 
no faster than permitted by regulations (currently one year).

Malus and clawback provisions apply to LTIP awards, as set out on 
page 96.

The maximum annual LTIP 
award for the CEO is 140% of 
Fixed Pay (cash and shares) and 
134% of Fixed Pay (cash and 
shares) for the GFD.

Vesting is dependent on 
performance measures 
and service.

Forward-looking performance 
measures will be based on 
financial performance and other 
long-term strategic measures. 
The Committee has discretion 
to change the weightings but 
financial measures will be at least 
70% of the total opportunity.

Measures and weightings will 
be set in advance of each grant. 
The threshold and maximum level 
of performance for each financial 
performance measure will be 
disclosed annually as part of 
the annual report on Directors' 
remuneration. Straight-line 
vesting applies between threshold 
and maximum for the financial 
measures with no more than 25% 
vesting at threshold performance.

Directors' remuneration policy

Element and purpose Operation
Maximum value and 
performance measures

Risk and conduct 
adjustment, malus 
and clawback
Malus and clawback 
provisions discourage 
excessive risk-taking and 
inappropriate behaviours

Any bonus or LTIP awarded is subject to malus and clawback 
provisions. 

The malus provisions enable the Committee to reduce the amount 
of unvested bonus or LTIP (including to nil) prior to vesting in specified 
circumstances, including, but not limited to:

■■ a participant deliberately misleading Barclays, the market and/or 
shareholders in relation to the financial performance of the 
Barclays Group 

■■ a participant causing harm to Barclays' reputation or where his/her 
actions have amounted to misconduct, incompetence or negligence

■■ a material restatement of the financial statements of the Barclays 
Group or any subsidiary, or the Group or any business unit suffering 
a material downturn in its financial performance

■■ a material failure of risk management in the Barclays Group
■■ a significant deterioration in the financial health of the Barclays 

Group.
The clawback provisions enable amounts to be recovered after they 
have vested (for a period of seven years from grant/10 years in 
circumstances where a relevant investigation is ongoing at the end 
of the initial seven-year period) where (i) a participant's actions or 
omissions have amounted to misbehaviour or material error and/or 
(ii) Barclays or the relevant business unit has suffered a material failure 
of risk management.

All-employee share plans 
To provide an opportunity 
for Executive Directors to 
voluntarily invest in the 
Company through UK HMRC 
employee tax advantaged 
share schemes

Executive Directors are entitled to participate in:

(i) Barclays Sharesave under which they can make monthly savings out 
of post-tax pay over a period of three or five years linked to the grant of 
an option over Barclays' shares which can be at a discount of up to 
20% on the share price set at the start.

(ii) Barclays Sharepurchase under which they can make contributions 
(monthly or lump sum) out of pre-tax pay (if based in the UK) which 
are used to acquire Barclays' shares.

(i)  Savings between £5 and the 
maximum set by Barclays (which 
will be no more than the HMRC 
maximum) per month. There are 
no performance measures.

(ii) Contributions of between £10 
and the maximum set by Barclays 
(which will be no more than the 
HMRC maximum) per tax year 
which Barclays may match up to 
HMRC maximum (current match 
is £600). There are no 
performance measures.

Outside appointments
To encourage 
self-development

Executive Directors may accept one Non-Executive Director Board 
appointment in another listed company.

The Chairman's approval must be sought before accepting an 
appointment. Fees may be retained by the Executive Director. Neither 
of the Executive Directors currently hold an outside appointment.

Not applicable.

Element and purpose Operation
Maximum value and 
performance measures

Shareholding 
requirement
To further enhance the 
alignment of shareholders' 
and Executive Directors' 
interests in long-term 
value creation

Executive Directors have a contractual obligation to build up a 
shareholding equivalent to the maximum variable pay opportunity 
within five years from the date of appointment as Executive Director, 
i.e.:

■■ Group Chief Executive: 233% of Fixed Pay
■■ Group Finance Director: 224% of Fixed Pay

Executive Directors will have a reasonable period to build up to this 
requirement again if it is not met because of a significant share price 
depreciation.

Executive Directors also have a contractual obligation to maintain their 
shareholding for two years following the last day of active service as 
follows:

(i)  if the Executive Director has been employed for more than five 
years: 233% of Fixed Pay for the CEO and 224% of Fixed Pay for the 
GFD; or

(ii)  if the Executive Director has been employed for less than five years: 
either

 (a)  grow their holding to the pro-rated requirement if the pro-rated 
requirement has not been met. Directors would only be allowed 
to sell shares to pay for tax liabilities which crystallise when 
deferred awards vest on or after termination; or

 (b)  if the pro-rated requirement has been exceeded, Executive 
Directors would be allowed to sell shares above this requirement 
and also sell shares to pay for tax liabilities which crystallise 
when deferred awards vest on or after termination. 

Shares that count towards the requirement are beneficially owned 
shares including any vested share awards subject only to holding 
periods (including vested LTIPs, vested deferred share bonuses, 
Fixed Pay shares, and any legacy RBP shares). Shares from unvested 
deferred share bonuses and unvested LTIPs do not count towards 
the requirement during employment, but will count towards 
post-termination requirements (net of tax) provided that there 
are no remaining untested performance conditions.

Barclays' shares worth a 
minimum of 233% of Fixed Pay 
for the CEO and 224% of Fixed 
Pay for the GFD must be held 
within five years, as well as for 
two years post-termination 
(or pro rata thereof) commencing 
from last day in office.

Performance measures and targets
The Committee selects financial performance measures which are fundamental to delivery against the Bank's strategy and are considered to be 
the most important financial measures used by the Executive Directors to oversee the direction of the business. The non-financial performance 
measures and sources of data are chosen to represent key indicators of sustainable performance, aligned with strategy and culture, that are 
robustly monitored and reported on to management. The measures are determined in consultation with major shareholders.

Financial targets are set to be stretching but achievable and are aligned to enhancing shareholder value. In respect of the LTIP, the financial 
measures, weightings and targets will be disclosed at the start of the relevant performance period. In respect of the annual bonus, the financial 
measures and weightings will be disclosed at the start of the relevant performance year. The Committee is of the opinion that the financial targets 
for the annual bonus are commercially sensitive in respect of the Company and that it would be detrimental to disclose details at the start of the 
relevant performance year. Performance against the targets will be disclosed at the end of the relevant performance year in that year's 
remuneration report, subject to commercial sensitivity no longer remaining.

The Performance Measurement Framework assesses progress against our key strategic and non-financial goals. The evaluation will focus on key 
performance measures with a detailed retrospective disclosure on progress throughout the period against each category, together with 
supporting rationale for payments.

REMUNERATION REPORT

Directors' remuneration policy

Alignment between the Executive Directors' remuneration policy and all employees' policy  
of the Group
The structure of remuneration packages for Executive Directors is closely aligned with that for the broader employee population. Employees 
receive salary, pension and benefits and are eligible to be considered for a bonus and to participate in all-employee share plans. The broader 
employee population typically does not have a contractual limit on the quantum of remuneration and does not receive Role Based Pay (RBP) 
which is paid only to some, but not all, MRTs and other senior employees.

As with Executive Directors, variable pay for the broader employee population is performance based. Variable pay for Executive Directors and the 
broader employee population is subject to deferral requirements. Executive Directors and other MRTs are subject to deferral at a minimum rate of 
40% (for variable pay of less than £500,000) or 60% (for variable pay between £500,000 and £1,000,000). For non-MRTs, bonuses in excess of 
£65,000 are currently subject to a graduated level of deferral. The terms of deferred bonus awards for Executive Directors and the wider employee 
population are broadly the same, in particular the vesting of all deferred bonuses is subject to service and malus conditions. The broader employee 
population does not participate in the Barclays LTIP.

While we have not sought employee views on the DRP, we have considered all employee policies when reviewing the DRP and have explained the 
DRP changes in our Fair Pay Report.

How shareholder views are taken into account by the Committee in setting the policy
We recognise that remuneration is an area of particular interest to shareholders and that in setting and considering changes to remuneration, it is 
important that we listen to and take into account their views. Accordingly, a series of meetings are held each year with major shareholders and 
shareholder representative groups. The Committee Chairman attended these meetings, accompanied by senior Barclays' employees (including the 
Group Reward and Performance Director and the Group Company Secretary).

In developing the new policy, we consulted shareholders during 2019. The Committee notes that shareholder views on some matters are not 
always unanimous; however, the interactions are constructive and insightful. The engagement is meaningful and helpful to the Committee in its 
work and contributes directly to the decisions made by the Committee.

Discretion
In addition to the various operational discretions that the Committee can exercise in the performance of its duties (including those discretions set 
out in the Company's share plans), the Committee reserves the right to make either minor or administrative amendments to the policy to benefit 
its operation or to make more material amendments in order to comply with new laws, regulations and/or regulatory guidance. The Committee 
would only exercise this right if it believed it was in the best interests of the Company to do so and where it is not possible, practicable or 
proportionate to seek or await shareholder approval in a General Meeting.

Provisions of previous policy which will continue to apply
For the avoidance of doubt, any awards granted under the previous Directors' remuneration policy which have not yet vested shall continue to be 
capable of vesting on their normal vesting schedule.

Executive Directors' policy on recruitment
Barclays operates in a highly specialised sector and many of its competitors for talent are outside of the UK. The Committee's approach to 
remuneration on recruitment is to pay the amount necessary to attract the best candidates to the role.

Approval of the remuneration packages offered on appointment to any new Executive Director is a specific requirement of the Committee's Terms 
of Reference. The terms of such packages must be approved by the Committee in consultation with the Chairman and (except for the terms of his 
own remuneration) the Group Chief Executive. 

Any new Executive Director's package would include the same elements as those of the existing Executive Directors, as shown below.

Element and purpose Commentary Maximum value

Fixed Pay
Determined by skills, 
experience, market practice, 
market conditions and ability 
to recruit

Determined by skills and experience appropriate 
for the scale, complexity and responsibilities of the 
role, and by market practice, market conditions 
and ability to recruit. 

In line with financial regulations, Fixed Pay is a 
derivative of total compensation. Executive 
Directors' total compensation is benchmarked 
against comparable roles in the following banks: 
Bank of America, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Credit 
Suisse, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, JP Morgan Chase & 
Co, Lloyds, Morgan Stanley, Standard Chartered 
and UBS. The Committee may amend the list of 
comparator companies to ensure it remains 
relevant to Barclays or if circumstances make this 
necessary (for example, as a result of takeovers or 
mergers).

As determined by the Committee with reference 
to these factors. Fixed Pay will only exceed amounts 
paid to current Executive Directors, as considered 
reasonable by the Committee, by reference to 
these factors.

Once appointed, increases will normally be aligned to 
the annual increase for UK employees, and will take 
into account changes in responsibilities and market 
conditions.

Pension In line with policy In line with policy

Benefits In line with policy In line with policy

Annual bonus In line with policy In line with policy

Long Term Incentive Plan 
(LTIP) award

In line with policy In line with policy

Buy-out The Committee can consider buying out forfeited 
bonus opportunity or incentive awards that the 
new Executive Director has forfeited as a result 
of accepting the appointment with Barclays, 
subject to proof of forfeiture where applicable.

As required by the PRA Remuneration Rules, 
any award made to compensate for forfeited 
remuneration from the new Executive Director's 
previous employment may not be more generous 
than, and must mirror as far as possible the 
expected value, timing and form of delivery of, 
the terms of the forfeited remuneration and must 
be in the best long-term interests of Barclays. 
Barclays' deferral policy shall however apply 
as a minimum to any buy-out of annual 
bonus opportunity.

The value of any buy-out is not included within the 
maximum incentive levels above since it relates to a 
buy-out of forfeited bonus opportunity or incentive 
awards from a previous employer.

Where a senior executive is promoted to the Board, his or her existing contractual commitments agreed prior to his or her appointment may 
still be honoured in accordance with the terms of the relevant commitment, including vesting of any pre-existing deferred bonus or long-term 
incentive awards.

REMUNERATION REPORT

Directors' remuneration policy

Executive Directors' policy on payment for loss of office (including or following a takeover)
The Committee's approach to payments in the event of termination is to take account of the individual circumstances including the reason for 
termination, individual performance, contractual obligations and the terms of the deferred bonus plans and LTIPs in which the Executive Director 
participates.

Provisions relating to Executive Directors' termination

Standard provision Commentary Maximum value

Notice periods in 
Executive Directors' 
service contracts

For existing Executive Directors, 12 months' notice from the 
Company and six months' notice from the Executive Director.

For new Executive Director hires, six months' notice from the 
Company and six months' notice from the Executive Director.

Executive Directors may be required to work 
during the notice period or may be placed 
on garden leave or, if not required to work 
the full notice period, may be provided with 
pay in lieu of notice (subject to mitigation 
where relevant).

Pay during notice 
period or payment 
in lieu of notice per 
service contracts

Fixed Pay payable and continuation of pension allowance and 
other contractual benefits while an employee during notice 
period.

Fixed Pay delivered in cash is payable in 
phased instalments (or lump sum) and 
subject to mitigation if paid in instalments 
and Executive Director obtains alternative 
employment during the notice period or while 
on garden leave.

Fixed Pay delivered in shares is delivered on 
the next quarterly delivery date and is 
pro-rated for the number of days from the 
start of the relevant quarter to the termination 
date. Where Barclays elects to terminate the 
employment with immediate effect by making 
a payment in lieu of notice, the Executive 
Director will not receive any shares that would 
otherwise have been payable during the 
period for which the payment in lieu is made 
(unless required otherwise by regulations or 
local law).

In the event of termination for gross 
misconduct neither notice nor payment in lieu 
of notice is given.

Treatment of 
annual bonus 
on termination

No automatic entitlement to bonus on termination, but may be 
considered at the Committee's discretion, pro-rated for service, 
and subject to performance measures being met.

No bonus would be payable in the case of gross misconduct 
or resignation.

Standard provision Commentary Maximum value

Treatment of 
unvested deferred 
bonus awards

In the case of death or if the Executive Director is an ‘eligible 
leaver' the Executive Director would continue to be eligible to be 
considered for unvested portions of deferred awards, subject to 
the rules of the relevant plan, unless the Committee determines 
otherwise in exceptional circumstances. ‘Eligible leaver' is defined 
as leaving due to injury, disability or ill health, retirement, 
redundancy, the business or company which employs the 
Executive Director ceasing to be part of the Group or the 
employer terminating employment, other than in circumstances 
which amount to gross misconduct or dismissal for cause. 
In addition, the Committee will apply its discretion to treat 
resignation on or after the fifth anniversary of the date of grant as 
‘eligible leaver' status. Outstanding deferred bonus awards would 
lapse if the Executive Director leaves by reason of resignation 
prior to fifth anniversary, is terminated for gross misconduct or 
cause, or is otherwise not designated an ‘eligible leaver'.

Deferred awards are subject to malus provisions which enable 
the Committee to reduce the vesting level of deferred bonuses 
(including to nil) and once vested are subject to clawback 
provisions (as described above).

In the event of a takeover or other major corporate event, the 
Committee has absolute discretion to determine whether all 
outstanding awards would vest early or whether they should 
continue in the same or revised form following the change of 
control. The Committee may also determine that participants 
may exchange existing awards for awards over shares in an 
acquiring company with the agreement of that company.

In an ‘eligible leaver' situation, deferred bonus 
awards may be considered for release in full 
on the scheduled release dates unless the 
Committee determines otherwise in 
exceptional circumstances. On death, awards 
are accelerated and released in full. After 
release, the shares are subject to an additional 
holding period to the extent required by 
regulations (currently a minimum 12-month 
holding period applies).

Treatment of 
unvested awards 
under the LTIP

In the case of death or if the Executive Director is an ‘eligible 
leaver' the Executive Director would continue to be entitled to 
be considered for an award. ‘Eligible leaver' is defined as leaving 
due to injury, disability or ill health, retirement, redundancy, 
the business or company which employs the Executive Director 
ceasing to be part of the Group or for any other reason if the 
Committee decides at its discretion. In addition, the Committee 
will apply its discretion to treat resignation on or after the 
fifth anniversary of the date of grant as ‘eligible leaver' status. 
Outstanding unvested awards under the LTIP would lapse if the 
Executive Director leaves by reason of resignation prior to fifth 
anniversary, is terminated for gross misconduct, or is otherwise 
not designated an ‘eligible leaver'.

Awards are subject to malus provisions which enable the 
Committee to reduce the vesting level of awards (including to nil) 
and once vested, awards are subject to clawback provisions 
(as described above).

In the event of a takeover or other major corporate event 
(but excluding an internal reorganisation of the Group), 
the Committee has absolute discretion to determine whether 
all outstanding awards vest subject to the achievement of any 
performance conditions. The Committee has discretion to apply 
a pro rata reduction to reflect the unexpired part of the vesting 
period. The Committee may also determine that participants 
may exchange awards for awards over shares in an acquiring 
company with the agreement of that company. In the event of 
an internal reorganisation, the Committee may determine that 
outstanding awards will be exchanged for equivalent awards 
in another company.

In an ‘eligible leaver' situation awards may be 
considered for release on the scheduled 
release date. On death, awards are 
accelerated. In both cases, awards are 
pro-rated for time (over the whole 
performance period, including the assessment 
period prior to grant) and performance, 
subject to the Committee's discretion to 
determine otherwise, in accordance with the 
plan rules, as amended from time to time. 
After release, the shares are subject to an 
additional holding period to the extent 
required by regulations (currently a minimum 
12-month holding period applies).

REMUNERATION REPORT

Directors' remuneration policy

Standard provision Commentary Maximum value

Repatriation Except in the case of gross misconduct or resignation, where an 
Executive Director has been relocated at the commencement of 
employment, the Company may pay for the Executive Director's 
repatriation costs in line with Barclays' general employee mobility 
policy including temporary accommodation, payment of removal 
costs and relocation flights for the Executive Director, spouse 
and children. The Company will pay the Executive Director's tax 
on the relocation costs but will not tax equalise and will also not 
pay tax on his or her other income relating to the termination 
of employment.

Other Except in the case of gross misconduct or resignation, the 
Company may pay for the Executive Director's legal fees and tax 
advice relating to the termination of employment and provide 
outplacement services. The Company may pay the Executive 
Director's tax on these particular costs.

Illustrative scenarios for Executive Directors' remuneration
The charts below show the potential value of the current Executive Directors' 2020 total remuneration in three main scenarios: ‘Minimum'
(i.e. Fixed Pay, Pension and benefits), ‘Mid-point' (i.e. Fixed Pay, Pension, benefits and 50% of the maximum variable pay that may be awarded)
and ‘Maximum' (i.e. Fixed Pay, Pension, benefits and the maximum variable pay that may be awarded). For the purposes of these charts, the value
of benefits is based on an estimated annual value for 2020 regular contractual benefits. Additional ad hoc benefits may arise, for example, 
overseas relocation of Executive Directors, but will always be provided in line with the DRP.

A significant proportion of the potential remuneration of the Executive Directors is variable and is therefore performance related. It is also subject 
to deferral, additional holding periods, malus and clawback. In line with the new reporting requirements, we have provided an indication of the 
maximum remuneration receivable, assuming share price appreciation of 50% on the LTIP.

Remuneration policy – Non-Executive Directors
Element and purpose Operation Maximum value

Fees
Reflect individual responsibilities 
and membership of Board 
Committees and are set to attract 
Non-Executive Directors who 
have relevant skills and 
experience to oversee the 
implementation of our strategy

Fees are set at a level which 
reflects the role, responsibilities 
and time commitment which 
are expected from the Chairman 
and Non-Executive Directors

The Chairman is paid an all-inclusive fee for all Board 
responsibilities. The Chairman has a time commitment 
equivalent of up to 80% of a full-time role. The other 
Non-Executive Directors receive a basic Board fee, with 
additional fees payable where individuals serve as a 
member or Chairman of a Committee of the Board. 

Fees are periodically reviewed by the Board.

Some Non-Executive Directors may also receive fees as 
directors of subsidiary companies of Barclays PLC. In the 
case of certain subsidiary appointments, such additional 
remuneration is approved by the Barclays PLC Board 
Remuneration Committee. 

Fees are reviewed against those for Non-
Executive Directors in companies of similar 
size and complexity. Other than in exceptional 
circumstances, fees will not increase by more 
than 20% above the current fee levels during 
this policy period.

Benefits
To provide a competitive and 
cost-effective benefits package 
appropriate to the role 
and location

The Chairman is provided with private medical cover subject to the terms of the Barclays' scheme rules from 
time to time, and is provided with the use of a Company vehicle and driver when required for business 
purposes (including settlement of any tax liabilities that may arise from this benefit). 

Benefits which are minor in nature and in any event do not exceed a cost of £500 may be provided to 
Non-Executive Directors in specific circumstances.

Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to join Barclays' pension plans.

Expenses The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are reimbursed for any reasonable and appropriate expenses 
incurred for business reasons. Any tax that arises on these reimbursed expenses is paid by Barclays.

Bonus and share plans The Chairman may be invited to participate in Sharesave, an HMRC employee tax advantaged share scheme, 
due to the level of his time commitment to the role. The Chairman is not eligible to participate in any other 
Barclays' cash, share or long-term incentive plans.

All other Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in Barclays' cash, share or long-term incentive 
plans.

Shareholding requirements Chairman: £100,000 (Non-Executive Directors: £30,000) gross before deduction of tax and other statutory 
deductions per annum of each Non-Executive Director's basic fee is used to purchase Barclays' shares which 
are retained on the Non-Executive Director's behalf until they retire from the Board.

Notice and termination 
provisions

Each Non-Executive Director's appointment is for an initial three-year term, renewable at Barclays' discretion 
for a further term of three years thereafter and subject to annual re-election by shareholders. Non-Executive 
Directors appointed beyond six years will be at the discretion of the Board Nominations Committee. 

Notice period
Chairman: Six months from the Company (six months from the Chairman).

Termination payment policy
The Chairman's appointment may be terminated by Barclays on six months' notice or immediately in 
which case six months' fees are payable in instalments at the times they would have been received had the 
appointment continued, but subject to mitigation if he or she were to obtain alternative employment. No 
continuing payments of fees (or benefits) are due if a Non-Executive Director is not re-elected by 
shareholders at the Barclays AGM.

In accordance with the policy table above, any new Chairman would be paid an all-inclusive fee only and any new Non-Executive Director would 
be paid a basic fee for their appointment as a Non-Executive Director, plus fees for their participation on and/or chairing of any Board committees, 
time apportioned in the first year as necessary. No sign-on payments are offered to Non-Executive Directors.

Notes
a The LTIP amounts include a 14% share price depreciation between date of grant and vesting date (based on Q4 2019 average price).
b The LTIP amount includes a 4% share price depreciation between date of grant and vesting date.
c LTIP and dividend equivalent figures for 2018 have been adjusted to reflect the share price on the date of vesting (1.60p) rather than the Q4 2018 average price and additional 

dividend paid in February 2019.
d As previously disclosed, malus was applied to Jes Staley's 2016 variable compensation.

Additional information in respect of each element of pay for the Executive Directors (audited)
1) Fixed Pay
Fixed Pay is delivered 50% in cash and 50% in shares (subject to a five-year holding period lifting pro rata).

2) Pension
Executive Directors are paid cash in lieu of pension contributions. The pension cash allowance in 2019 was £396,000 for Jes Staley and £200,000 
for Tushar Morzaria. No other benefits were received by the Executive Directors from any Barclays' pension plan.

3) Taxable benefits
Taxable benefits include private medical cover, life assurance, income protection, tax advice, car allowance and the use of a Company vehicle and 
driver when required for business purposes.

4) Annual bonus
The bonus amount included in the single total figure is the value awarded or scheduled to be awarded in Q1 following the financial year to which it 
relates. The Committee considered the Executive Directors' performance against the financial (60% weighting) and strategic non-financial (20% 
weighting) performance measures which had been set to reflect Company priorities for 2019. Performance against their individual personal 
objectives (20% weighting) was assessed on an individual basis.

The approach taken to assessing financial performance against each of the financial measures was based on a straight-line outcome between 
20% for threshold performance and 100% applicable to each measure for achievement of maximum performance. A summary of the assessment 
is provided in the following table:

Strategic (20% weighting)
Progress in relation to each of the strategic measures, organised around three main categories, was assessed by the Committee. Within each of 
the three categories, the overall outcome was assessed based on the following scale: 0% to 1%: Behind track on most measures, 1.5% to 3%: 
Slightly behind track on most measures, 3.5% to 5.5%: On track or slightly ahead of track for most measures, and 6% or 7%: Ahead of track on 
most measures. On this basis, the Committee agreed an overall outcome of 14% out of a maximum of 20%. The detail supporting this assessment

Individual outcomes including assessment of personal objectives
Individual performance against each of the Executive Directors' personal objectives (20% weighting overall) was assessed by the Committee 
(objectives as set out on page 121 of the 2018 Annual Report).

The below summarises their performance against the shared personal objectives:

Shared objectives for Jes Staley and 
Tushar Morzaria Outcomes

Continue to deliver improving shareholder 
returns, while retaining the focus on 
delivering the 2019 and 2020 external targets 
and, specifically, profitability of the CIB

■■ Strong financial improvements delivered, 2019 RoTE in line with target of 9.0%, while CET1 
increased to 13.8%

■■ Continued progress towards target of cost: income ratio below 60%, reducing three 
percentage points over the year from 66% to 63%

■■ Material improvement to CIB profitability, with PBT increasing 15%
■■ Returns to shareholders also significantly increased, with total dividend for 2019 of 9p – 

up from 6.5p in 2018

Identify opportunities for further cost 
efficiencies, enabling reinvestment into 
strategic priorities

■■ Cost guidance of below £13.6bn delivered in 2019
■■ Significant cost focus, with numerous actions taken to drive efficiencies to create capacity 

for reinvestment
■■ Reinvestment has been focused in areas such as our long-term technology strategy (including 

our focus on ‘becoming more digital') as well as material growth initiatives in our businesses
■■ We invested nearly twice as much last year in building the Barclays of the future as the 

year before

Leverage the new Barclays Execution Services 
platform to drive our technology agenda 
across operating businesses to improve 
customer and client experience and enhance 
value

■■ The Barclays Execution Services platform has helped us to reduce duplication, simplify our 
operating environment and re-engineer our processes

■■ Changing our businesses to work in a more efficient way has enabled a renewed focus on our 
customers and clients and how we serve them

■■ Examples include Corporate Banking, where over 80% of our corporate clients are using our 
single digital platform and our retail businesses, where 91% of customer transactions are now 
automated across all our channels

■■ This also extends to investment in continuing to protect our customers' data, and ensuring 
that our businesses are better controlled and more resilient, so things are less likely to go 
wrong for our customers and clients

Respond to emerging Brexit decisions, 
managing risks appropriately for the Group, 
while continuing to support our customers 
and clients in the UK

■■ Risks associated with Brexit have been proactively managed, with the Bank fully prepared for 
different potential scenarios

■■ Barclays Bank Ireland fully established and prepared to transact across European client base
■■ UK customer and client service maintained throughout Brexit preparatory work

In addition to the shared personal objectives described above, the table below summarises Jes Staley's performance against the objectives specific 
to him.

Jes Staley's objectives Outcomes

Oversee the effective management of the risk 
and controls agenda, including cyber risks

■■ Jes has overseen the effective management of the risk and controls agenda. In particular, his 
ongoing focus on the Barclays Improved Controls Enhancement Programme (BICEP) has 
delivered significant improvements in the control environment and is close to conclusion

■■ There has also been a dramatic year on year reduction in more impactful controls-related 
issues, with a corresponding improvement in performance assessments in internal audits

■■ From a cyber perspective, the result of a recent CapGemini Cyber Security Maturity 
Assessment was Barclays' highest score in four years

Further improve customer and client 
satisfaction, with continued focus on 
complaint reduction

■■ Jes has worked with the Board to ensure that focusing on customers and clients is a key 
strategic pillar for the Group. This focus has led to a number of process improvements while 
designing our business around what our customers want and how they would like to 
achieve it

■■ Jes has also personally increased his client engagement substantially compared with 2018
■■ He has continued to personally focus on reducing customer complaints volumes, and has 

overseen a further reduction in 2019 of 8% (excluding PPI), on top of the 9% reduction 
in 2018

Annual report on 
Directors' remuneration

REMUNERATION REPORT

Jes Staley's objectives Outcomes

Develop further a high performing culture in 
line with our values, continuing to focus on 
employee engagement and the talent pipeline 
for Group, Business and Functional Executive 
Committees with a particular emphasis on 
improving the percentage of women in senior 
leadership roles

■■ As outlined in the 2018 Fair Pay Report, Jes took accountability for increasing female 
representation in January 2019

■■ He also personally launched a set of 2019 specific initiatives aiming to make the biggest 
difference most quickly to the proportion of women in senior leadership positions. The 
outcome has been an improvement to 25% (2018: 24%), with steady progress made towards 
the 2021 target 

■■ Significant progress has been made in succession planning and the talent pipeline. There are 
now succession plans in place for all businesses and functions. Additionally, Jes restructured 
the Group Executive Committee to ensure closer business focus

■■ Employee engagement has remained an important focus of Jes and the Executive Committee. 
As noted in the non-financial assessment, despite some very positive indicators the overall 
engagement score reduced slightly based primarily on views relating to tools and resources. 
Investment in technology is underway to address these issues.

Effectively manage relationships with key 
external stakeholders and society more 
broadly

■■ Jes has dedicated a significant amount of time to actively engaging with external stakeholders 
including regulators, the Government and investors

■■ The impact Jes has had on society more broadly has also been very positive across a large 
number of areas. Examples include Barclays becoming a founding member of the UN 
Principles for Responsible Banking, as well as being recognised in Fortune Magazine's 2018 
Change the World List for the first time for positive social impact connected to core business 
strategy

■■ Overall, external relationships have been effectively managed by Jes, with positive feedback 
received, in particular in relation to the delivery and execution of the Bank's strategy

Recognising his very strong performance against both his individual and shared personal objectives during 2019, the Committee assessed that 
an outcome of 16% out of a maximum of 20% was appropriate. 

The Committee reflected on the aggregate outcome for Jes Staley under the formulaic components of the annual bonus framework. 

The Committee noted that the formulaic outcome of 83.3% was supported by very strong delivery against both the financial and non-financial 
performance measures. In finalising the outcome, the Committee considered all relevant factors, including outcomes for the wider workforce. 
It noted that overall bonus pool was down 10%. It also observed that the linkage between Executive Director outcomes and those of the wider 
workforce is not always correlated, e.g. in 2018 the executive bonus outcomes were slightly down based on their performance against plan 
targets, while the overall bonus pool increased. Recognising the different basis of approaches, the Committee reflected on the appropriate final 
bonus outcome for the Executive Directors. It decided that to increase alignment with the wider workforce, a discretionary reduction would be 
applied to the formulaic outcomes for both Executive Directors in line with the reduction to the overall incentive pool, i.e. a reduction of 10%. 
On that basis the outcome for Jes Staley is a bonus of 75.0% or £1,647,000 (of which 76% will be deferred under the Share Value Plan).

The table below summarises Tushar Morzaria's performance against the objectives specific to him. In addition to his performance against the 
objectives below, Tushar successfully led a significant project with the UK regulators to change the capital calculation basis. Additionally, he led 
the successful completion of the external stress tests run by the Bank of England, the European Banking Authority and the Federal Reserve 
(CCAR). He also continues to oversee the significant additional reporting, capital and liquidity management requirements under the new 
subsidiary entity structure (following the establishment of the ring-fenced bank and the US Intermediate Holding Company). During 2019, Tushar 
also became accountable for overseeing the Strategy function, and led the enhanced reviews of strategy by the Board.

Tushar Morzaria's objectives Outcomes

Demonstrate effective management of 
external relationships, particularly regulators 
and investors

■■ Feedback continues to indicate that external relationships have been managed very effectively, 
including both with regulators and investors

■■ Tushar has been appointed by the Bank of England to Chair the Sterling Risk Free Reference 
Rates Working Group, which demonstrates his ongoing positive external impact

Oversee the effective management of the risk 
and controls agenda in Group Finance, Tax 
and Treasury

■■ The Risk and Controls agenda in Group Finance, Tax and Treasury remains an area of focus, 
with progress made in particular in the Treasury function

■■ While progress has been made, there is still more work to do to ensure our rigorous control 
environment enables us to deliver the right outcome for all stakeholders

Progress finance transformation programme 
and drive benefits across Group Finance, Tax 
and Treasury

■■ The transformation programme is complete, with the new operating model fully embedded 
across the whole function, including Group Finance, Tax and Treasury

■■ Benefits have included the creation of additional capacity, enabling enhanced focus on 
process and technology improvements, e.g. the financial planning and related stress testing 
processes

Tushar Morzaria's objectives Outcomes

Continue to develop talent base, employee 
engagement and gender diversity in Group 
Finance, Tax and Treasury

■■ Strong progress has been made on the talent pipeline within the Finance function, combining 
strategic external hiring with internal talent development. The leadership succession pipeline 
has been significantly enhanced, in particular with female talent

■■ Gender diversity has also been increased outside of the management team, with a 2% 
increase in senior women across the function (at 26% before transfers)

■■ Levels of employee engagement have increased by 1% to 76% in the Your View employee 
survey

The Committee also recognised Tushar Morzaria's very strong performance against both his individual and shared personal objectives during 
2019, assessing that an outcome of 17% out of a maximum of 20% was appropriate. In aggregate, this results in an overall formulaic outcome for 
Tushar of 84.3%. On the same basis as described above, the Committee decided that to increase alignment with the wider workforce, a 10% 
reduction would be applied to this outcome. On that basis the outcome for Tushar Morzaria is a bonus 75.9% or £1,123,000 (of which 64% will be 
deferred under the Share Value Plan).

In line with the DRP, and due to the regulations prohibiting dividend equivalents being paid on unvested deferred share awards, the number of 
shares awarded to each Executive Director under the Share Value Plan will be calculated using a share price at the date of award, discounted to 
reflect the absence of dividend equivalents during the vesting period. The valuation will be aligned to IFRS 2, with the market expectations of 
dividends during the deferral period being assessed by an independent adviser. These shares will vest in two equal tranches on the first and 
second anniversary (subject to the rules of the Share Value Plan as amended from time to time). All shares (whether deferred or not) are subject 
to a further one-year holding period from the point of release. 2019 bonuses are subject to clawback provisions and, additionally, unvested 
deferred 2019 bonuses are subject to malus provisions which enable the Committee to reduce the vesting level of deferred bonuses (including 
to nil).

5) LTIP
The LTIP amount included in the single total figure is the value of the amount scheduled to be released in relation to the LTIP award granted in 
2017 in respect of the performance period 2017-2019 (by reference to Q4 2019 average share price). Release is dependent on, among other things, 
performance over the period from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2019 with straight-line vesting applied between the threshold and maximum 
points. The performance achieved against the performance targets is as follows:

■■ Group CET1% grew from 12.4% to 13.8% over the period, and remained comfortably above the regulatory minimum 
throughout

■■ Stress test results showed continued improvement over the period. In 2017, the Bank of England recognised that the 
increases in CET1 capital and in Tier 1 leverage ratios over the year were sufficient for it to meet the systemic reference 
points in the test. Barclays passed the 2018 and 2019 tests

■■ Our liquidity risk appetite measure and the Liquidity Coverage Ratio remained above targets

4%

Controls ■■ The Barclays Internal Control Enhancement Programme (BICEP) was launched in 2017 to transform the Bank's 
approach to the control environment. As at the end of 2019, 99% of BICEP milestones had been achieved

■■ The Bank has now transitioned to a ‘business as usual' environment. The Barclays Control Framework has been 
implemented, enhancing visibility on controls and risks. Assessments of the control environment have continued to 
improve, reflecting continued focus on identifying and resolving control issues

4%

Conduct ■■ Conduct remains a key focus for Barclays. Senior-level conduct breaches are viewed as a proxy for a culture led ‘from 
the top'. Breaches remained low throughout the period

■■ Conduct Profiles across the Group showed a positive trend over the period, particularly in Culture and Strategy, 
although a need for continued focus remains

The LTIP award is also subject to a discretionary underpin whereby the Committee must be satisfied with the underlying financial health of the 
Group. The Committee was satisfied that this underpin was met, and accordingly determined that the award should vest at 48.5% of the 
maximum number of shares under the total award, to be released in five equal tranches annually, starting from June 2020. After release, the shares 
are subject to an additional six-month holding period.

Outstanding LTIP awards
LTIP awards granted during 2018
The performance measures for the awards made under the 2018-2020 LTIP cycle are as follows:

50% 10% of award vests for RoTE of 7.75%  
(based on an assumed CET1 ratio at the target of c.13.5%)

RoTE of 10.25%

Vesting of this element will depend on CET1 levels during the performance period:
■■ if CET1 goes below the MDR hurdle (12.1% as at 31 December 2019) in any year of the period, no part of 

the RoTE element will vest
■■ if CET1 goes below the MDR hurdle +150bps but remains above the hurdle during the period, the 

Committee will exercise its discretion to determine what portion of the RoTE element should vest, 
based on the causes of the CET1 reduction.

material items

20% 4% of award vests for average cost: income ratio of 62.5% Average cost: income ratio of 58%

Risk Scorecard 15% The Risk Scorecard captures a range of risks and is aligned with the annual incentive risk alignment framework

LTIP awards to be granted during 2020
The Committee decided to make an award under the 2020-2022 LTIP cycle to Jes Staley and Tushar Morzaria (based on their performance in 2019) 
with a face value at grant of 120% of their respective Total fixed pay at 31 December 2019.

The key objective of the LTIP is to incentivise the Executive Directors to deliver on the long-term strategy. The LTIP should support a competitive 
pay package for achieving good performance, while the calibration maximum should incentivise a stretch level of performance without 
encouraging excessive risk-taking. 

In its deliberations on the threshold and maximums for the LTIP financial measures, the Committee considered progress against the external 
targets. The Committee increased the threshold for the RoTE measure from 8.5% to 9%.

The 2020-2022 LTIP award will be subject to the following forward-looking performance measures: 

Performance measure Weighting Threshold Maximum vesting

Average return 
on tangible equity 
(RoTE) ex litigation 
and conduct and 
other material items

50% 10% of award vests for RoTE of 9.0% 
(based on an assumed CET1 ratio at the target of c.13.5%)

RoTE of 10.5%

Vesting of this element will depend on CET1 levels during the performance period:
■■ in line with regulatory requirements, if the CET1 ratio goes below the MDR hurdle during the performance 

period, the Committee will consider what part, if any, of this element should vest.

Average cost: income

Risk Scorecard 15% The Risk Scorecard captures a range of risks and is aligned with the annual incentive risk alignment 
framework shared with the regulators. The current framework measures performance against three broad 
categories – Capital and Liquidity, Control Environment and Conduct – using a combination of quantitative 
and qualitative metrics. The framework may be updated from time to time in line with the Group's risk 
strategy. Specific targets within each of the categories are deemed to be commercially sensitive. 
Retrospective disclosure will be made in the 2022 Remuneration Report, subject to commercial sensitivity

engagement, Maintain client rankings and increase market shares within CIB

■■ Colleagues: Continue to increase the % of women in leadership roles, Maintain engagement at healthy 
levels, Improve key metrics from 2019, including Enable scores

Annual report on 
Directors' remuneration

REMUNERATION REPORT

Group Chief Executive Pay ratio
The table below shows the ratios of the Group Chief Executive's total remuneration to the remuneration of UK employees since 2017. The change 
in the pay ratios for 2019 is explained in more detail below.

Option 25th percentile Median 75th percentile

2019 A 213 x 140 x 77 x

2018 A 126 x 85 x 45 x

2017 A 153 x 106 x 54 x

The regulations provide three options which may be used to calculate the pay for the employees at the 25th percentile, median and 75th 
percentile. We have used Option A, following guidance issued by some proxy advisers and institutional shareholders. Option A calculates pay for 
all employees on the same basis as the single figure for remuneration calculated for Executive Directors. The period for which employee pay has 
been calculated under Option A is the 2019 calendar year. The CEO pay ratios published in 2017 and 2018 were calculated using the year-end 
salary and bonus for the relevant performance year only. These have now been recalculated using Option A methodology.

The single figure for remuneration for each employee includes earned salary and allowances, annual incentive awarded for the 2019 calendar year, 
and an estimate of pension and benefits for 2019. Other elements of pay such as overtime and shift allowances have been excluded on the basis 
that they are not comparable with the pay structure for the CEO. The estimate of pension for each employee is based on 10% of salary, given that 
this is the percentage currently available to new hires in the UK. The estimate of benefits is based on the cost of core benefits available at each 
Corporate Grade, being private medical insurance, income protection and life assurance. The pay for part-time employees has been grossed-up to 
one FTE.

The pay at each quartile is set out in the table below:

25th percentile Median 75th percentile
Total pay Of which is salary Total pay Of which is salary Total pay Of which is salary

2019  27,875  23,000  42,362  34,432  77,488  61,158 

2018  26,587  21,624  39,390  31,461  74,685  57,466 

2017  25,341  20,223  36,568  28,978  71,628  55,000 

The pay ratios have increased between 2018 and 2019, due to an increase in the CEO single figure of remuneration, though employee pay at the 
LQ, median and UQ has also increased (up 5%, 8% and 4% respectively).

The CEO single figure of remuneration for 2019 is increased significantly, largely as a result of two exceptional circumstances:

■■ due to the long-term nature of LTIP awards, the CEO has not received any vesting LTIP for his first four years of service at Barclays. He will 
receive an LTIP payout for the first time in respect of 2019. This forms part of his remuneration package, as approved by shareholders. In 2019 
the LTIP vested at 48.5% of maximum. Going forward, any change in LTIP will be as a result of changes in the amount vesting, rather than 
entitlement to receive an award

■■ in 2018, there was a reduction of £500,000 applied to the single figure of remuneration as a result of malus adjustment made to the CEO's 
2016 incentive award during 2018. This decreased the CEO pay ratio in 2018.

Excluding these items, the median pay ratios would be 105x in 2019 and 98x in 2018.

The annual bonus for the CEO has also increased during 2019, while the overall incentive pool has decreased. While recognising that this was not 
an unusual occurrence, given the structured formulaic approach applied to Executive Directors' incentives (e.g. in 2018, Executive Directors' 
outcomes were down slightly on 2017 and the overall incentive pool was up over the same period), the Remuneration Committee reduced the 
formulaic bonus outcome against pre-determined performance measures by 10%.

Over the period 2017 to 2019, median employee pay has gone up from £36,568 in 2017 to £42,362 in 2019, up almost 16%. This is aligned with 
the CEO increase over the same period, excluding the LTIP (up 15%).

Barclays remuneration philosophy is set out earlier in this report, and all remuneration decisions for Executive Directors and the wider workforce 
are made within this framework. The CEO pay ratio is one of the outcomes of these decisions, which are explained in more detail in the 
Chairman's statement.

Total remuneration of the employees in the Barclays Group 
The table shows the number of employees in the Barclays Group as at 31 December 2018 and 2019 in bands by reference to total remuneration. 
Total remuneration comprises salary, RBP, other allowances, bonus and the value at award of LTIP awards.

Barclays is a global business. Of those employees earning above £1m in total remuneration for 2019 in the table below, 56% are based in the US, 
36% in the UK and 8% in the rest of the world.

Percentage change in Group Chief Executive's remuneration
The table below shows how the percentage change in the Group Chief Executive's salary, benefits and bonus between 2018 and 2019 compared 
with the percentage change in the average of each of those components of pay for UK based employees. 

We have chosen UK based employees as the comparator group as it is the most representative for pay structure comparisons. 

Fixed Pay Benefits
Annual 
bonus

2019
Group CEO 0% 5% 55%
Average employee 5% 0% -12%

The percentage change in the average fixed pay and the average annual bonus for UK employees is impacted by the rebalancing of a proportion of 
annual bonus into fixed pay for c.19,500 customer facing staff in Barclays UK. Without this rebalancing, the percentage change is +4% for fixed pay 
and -10% for annual bonus. While the average bonus is down by 10%, junior populations have been protected in line with our Fair Pay agenda.

Former Non-Executive: Reuben Jeffery III 
Reuben Jeffery III was appointed as a member of the Barclays US LLC (the US Intermediate Holding Company) Board on 15 October 2019. 
He received fees of $150,000 per annum for his role on the Barclays LLC Board, pro-rated for his period of service in 2019. 

AGM Statement
At the 2019 AGM, the vote on the 2018 Directors' Remuneration Report (Resolution 2) was passed with 70.79% of votes cast in favour. 
We describe below what we have done to identify and address the concerns of shareholders who voted against this resolution last year. 

We offered to engage with those of our top 30 shareholders who voted against Resolution 2, or who withheld their vote in relation to it, and were 
able to meet with a significant proportion of those shareholders. We understand from those shareholders who we have spoken to that they voted 
against Resolution 2 because of concerns over the malus adjustment applied in relation to the 2016 incentive award for the Group CEO, 
particularly in light of the penalty levied against the Company by the New York Department for Financial Services (NYDFS). 

Having reflected on the views expressed by the relevant shareholders, and as discussed with them during engagement, we are satisfied that the 
malus adjustment was appropriate. However, in light of the feedback from our shareholders, we acknowledge that we could have provided further 
information regarding the factors the Board and Remuneration Committee took into account. In particular, this could have addressed the fact that 
no material new facts came to light through the investigations conducted by the regulators that had not been taken into account by the Board in 
its determination of the appropriate malus adjustment, and the fact that the NYDFS penalty was directed against the Bank in relation to failings in 
its controls, and not against the individual in question.

We will take this into account in all of our external disclosures going forward, to ensure that we provide all of the information needed to properly 
explain our decisions.

to apply a ratio of the fixed to variable components of total remuneration of their MRTs that exceeds 1:1, provided the ratio does not exceed 1:2. 
On 15 November 2018, the Board of Barclays PLC as shareholder of Barclays Bank UK PLC approved an equivalent resolution in relation to MRTs 
within Barclays Bank UK PLC and any of its subsidiaries.

Barclays Board Remuneration Committee
The Board Remuneration Committee is responsible for overseeing Barclays' remuneration as described in more detail below.

Terms of Reference
The role of the Committee is to:

■■ set the overarching principles and parameters of remuneration policy across the Group
■■ consider and approve the remuneration arrangements of (i) the Chairman, (ii) the Executive Directors, (iii) members of the Barclays Group 

Executive Committee and any other senior executives specified by the Committee from time to time, and (iv) all other Group employees whose 
total annual compensation exceeds an amount determined by the Committee from time to time (currently £2m)

■■ exercise oversight for remuneration issues.

The Committee considers the overarching objectives, principles and parameters of remuneration policy across the Group to ensure it is adopting 
a coherent approach in respect of all employees. In discharging this responsibility the Committee seeks to ensure that the policy is fair and 
transparent, avoids complexity and assesses, among other things, the impact of pay arrangements in supporting the Group's culture, values and 
strategy and on all elements of risk management. The Committee also approves incentive pools for each of the Group, Barclays Bank PLC, Barclays 
Bank UK PLC and operations and functions, periodically reviews (at least annually) all material matters of retirement benefit design and governance, 
and exercises judgement in the application of remuneration policies to promote the long-term success of the Group for the benefit of 
shareholders. The Committee and its members work as necessary with other Board Committees, and is authorised to select and appoint its own 
advisers as required.

Annual report on 
Directors' remuneration

REMUNERATION REPORT

Remuneration Committee in 2019
The performance of the Committee was assessed internally as part of the annual effectiveness review of the Board of Barclays PLC. In line with the 
approach adopted for all Board Committees in 2019, the process involved completion of a tailored questionnaire by Committee members and 
standing attendees. 

The results confirm that the Committee is operating effectively. The Committee continues to be well constituted and provides an effective level of 
challenge and oversight of the areas within its remit. Consideration will be given to adding an additional member of the Committee following the 
departure of Dr Dambisa Moyo earlier in the year.

The Committee's focus has moved towards oversight of an existing and effective policy and management system, having addressed a number of 
important remuneration related issues in prior years.

The Committee's interaction with the Board, Board Committees and senior management is considered effective. In response to a request to 
provide feedback on interaction with subsidiary committees, the Committee's interaction with the principal subsidiary remuneration committees 
was also considered effective, and in line with regulatory requirements. 

Advisers to the Remuneration Committee
The Committee appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) as the independent adviser in October 2017. The Committee is satisfied that the advice 
provided by PwC to the Committee is independent and objective. PwC is a signatory to the voluntary UK Code of Conduct for executive 
remuneration consultants.

PwC was paid £112,000 (excluding VAT) for their advice to the Committee in 2019 relating to the Executive Directors (either exclusively or along 
with other employees within the Committee's Terms of Reference). In addition to advising the Committee, PwC provided unrelated consulting 
advice to the Group in respect of strategic advice on business, operational models and cost, corporate taxation, climate-related financial 
disclosures, data strategy, technology consulting and internal audit.

Throughout 2019, Willis Towers Watson (WTW) continued to provide the Committee with market data on compensation when considering 
incentive levels and remuneration packages. WTW were paid £66,000 (excluding VAT) in fees for their services. In addition to the services provided 
to the Committee, WTW also provides pensions and benefits advice, insurance brokerage and pensions advice and administration services to the 
Barclays Bank UK Retirement Fund.

In the course of its deliberations, the Committee also considers the views of the Group Chief Executive, the Group Human Resources Director 
and the Group Reward and Performance Director. The Group Finance Director and the Chief Risk Officer provide regular updates on Group and 
business financial performance and risk profiles respectively.

No Barclays' employee or Director participates in discussions with, or decisions of, the Committee relating to his or her own remuneration. 
No other advisers provided services to the Committee in the year.

 Risk management 

Barclays' risk management 
strategy
This section introduces the Group's approach 
to managing and identifying risks, and for 
fostering a strong risk culture.

Enterprise Risk Management 
Framework (ERMF)
The ERMF sets the strategic approach for risk 
management by defining standards, objectives 
and responsibilities for all areas of the Group. 
It is then approved by the Barclays PLC Board 
on recommendation of the Group Chief Risk 
Officer. It supports senior management in 
effective risk management and developing 
a strong risk culture.

The ERMF sets out:

■■ segregation of duties: the ERMF defines 
a Three Lines of Defence model

■■ principal risks faced by the Group. This list 
guides the organisation of the risk 
management function, and the 
identification, management and reporting 
of risks

■■ risk appetite requirements. This helps 
define the level of risk we are willing to 
undertake in our business

■■ roles and responsibilities for risk 
management: the ERMF sets out the 
accountabilities of the Group CEO and 
other senior managers, as well as Barclays 
PLC committees.

The ERMF is complemented by frameworks, 
policies and standards which are mainly 
aligned to individual principal risks:

■■ frameworks cover the management 
approach for a collection of related 
activities and define the associated policies 
used to govern them

■■ policies set out principles and other core 
requirements for the activities of the 
Group. Policies describe ‘what' must be 
done

■■ standards set out the key control 
objectives that describe how the 
requirements set out in the policy are met, 
and who needs to carry them out. 
Standards describe ‘how' controls should 
be undertaken.

Segregation of duties – the ‘Three 
Lines of Defence' model
The ERMF sets out a clear lines of defence 
model. All colleagues are responsible for 
understanding and managing risks within the 
context of their individual roles and 
responsibilities, as set out below:

■■ first line comprises all employees engaged 
in the revenue generating and client facing 
areas of the Group and all associated 
support functions, including Finance, 
Treasury, and Human Resources. The first 
line is responsible for identifying and 
managing the risks they generate, 
establishing a control framework, and 
escalating risk events to Risk and 
Compliance

■■ second line is comprised of the Risk and 
Compliance functions. The role of the 
second line is to establish the limits, rules 
and constraints under which first line 
activities shall be performed, consistent 
with the risk appetite of the Group, and to 
monitor the performance of the first line 
against these limits and constraints. 
Note that limits for a number of first line 
activities, related to operational risk, will 
be set by the first line and overseen by the 
Chief Controls Office. These will remain 
subject to supervision by the second line

■■ third line of defence is Internal Audit, who 
are responsible for providing independent 
assurance over the effectiveness of 
governance, risk management and control 
over current, systemic and evolving risks

■■ the Legal function provides support to all 
areas of the bank and is not formally part 
of any of the three lines. However, it is 
subject to second line oversight.

Principal risks
The ERMF identifies eight principal risks (see 
table on page 38 of this report) and sets out 
associated responsibilities and expectations 
around risk management standards.

Each of the principal risks is overseen by an 
accountable executive within the Group who 
is responsible for the framework, policies and 
standards that detail the related requirements. 
Risk reports to executive and Board 
committees are clearly organised by principal 
risk. In addition, certain risks span more than 
one principal risk; these are also subject to the 
ERMF and are reported to executive and Board 
committees.

Risk appetite for the principal risks
Risk appetite is defined as the level of risk 
which the Group's businesses are prepared 
to accept in the conduct of their activities. 
It sets the ‘tone from the top' and provides 
a basis for ongoing dialogue between 
management and Board with respect to 
the Group's current and evolving risk profile, 
allowing strategic and financial decisions 
to be made on an informed basis.

Risk appetite is approved by the Barclays PLC 
Board and disseminated across legal entities. 
Total Group risk appetite is supported by limits 
to control exposures and activities that have 
material concentration risk implications.

 Risk management 
RISK REVIEW

Risk committees
Various committees also fulfil important roles 
and responsibilities. Barclays business level 
product/risk type committees consider risk 
matters relevant to their business, and 
escalate as required to the Group Risk 
Committee (GRC), whose Chairman, in turn, 
escalates to the Barclays PLC Board 
Committees and the Barclays PLC Board.

In addition to setting the risk appetite of the 
Group, the Board is responsible for approving 
the ERMF, and reviewing all reputation risk 
matters. It receives regular information on 
the risk profile of the bank, and has ultimate 
responsibility for risk appetite and 
capital plans.

Further, there are three Board-level 
committees which oversee the application of 
the ERMF and implementation of key aspects. 
Membership of these committees is 
comprised solely of Non-Executive Directors 
providing independent oversight and 
challenge. These are detailed below:

■■ the Barclays PLC Board Risk Committee 
(BRC): the BRC monitors the Group's 
risk profile against the agreed appetite. 
Where actual performance differs from 
expectations, the actions taken by 
management are reviewed to ascertain 
that the BRC is comfortable with them. 
The BRC also reviews certain key risk 
methodologies, the effectiveness of risk 
management, and the Group's risk profile, 
including the material issues affecting each 
business portfolio and forward risk trends. 
The committee also commissions in-depth 
analyses of significant risk topics, which 
are presented by the Group CRO or senior 
risk managers

■■ the Barclays PLC Board Audit Committee 
(BAC): the BAC receives regular reports 
on the effectiveness of internal control 
systems, quarterly reports on material 
control issues of significance, and quarterly 
papers on accounting judgements 
(including impairment). It also receives 
a half-yearly review of the adequacy of 
impairment allowances, which it reviews 
relative to the risk inherent in the 
portfolios, the business environment, 
Barclays policies and methodologies.

■■ the Barclays PLC Board Remuneration 
Committee (RemCo): the RemCo receives a 
report on risk management performance 
and risk profile, and proposals on ex-ante 
and ex-post risk adjustments to variable 
remuneration. These inputs are considered 
in the setting of performance incentives.

The terms of reference and additional  
details on membership and activities  
for each of the principal Board committees  
are available from the corporate governance 
section of the Barclays website at:  
home.barclays/about-barclays/ 
barclays-corporate-governance.html

The Group Risk Committee (GRC) is the 
most senior executive body responsible for 
reviewing and monitoring the risk profile of 
the Group. This includes coverage of all 
principal risks, and any other material risks, to 
which the Group is exposed. The GRC reviews 
and recommends the proposed risk appetite 
and relative limits to the BRC. The committee 
covers all business units and legal entities with 
the Group and incorporates specific coverage 
of Barclays Bank Group.

Barclays' risk culture
Risk culture can be defined as the norms, 
attitudes and behaviours related to risk 
awareness, risk taking and risk management. 
This is reflected in how the Group identifies, 
escalates and manages risk matters.

Barclays is committed to maintaining a robust 
risk culture in which:

■■ management expect, model and reward 
the right behaviours from a risk and 
control perspective

■■ colleagues identify, manage and escalate 
risk and control matters, and meet their 
responsibilities around risk management.

Specifically, all employees regardless of their 
position, function or location, must play their 
part in the Group's risk management. 
Employees are required to be familiar with 
risk management policies which are relevant 
to their responsibilities, know how to escalate 
actual or potential risk issues, and have a 
role-appropriate level of awareness of the risk 
management process as defined by the ERMF.

Our Code of Conduct – the Barclays Way
Globally, all colleagues must attest to the 
‘Barclays Way', our Code of Conduct, and 
comply with all frameworks, policies and 
standards applicable to their roles. The Code 
of Conduct outlines the purpose and values 
which govern our ‘Barclays Way' of working 
across our business globally. It constitutes 
a reference point covering the aspects of 
colleagues' working relationships, with other 
Barclays employees, customers and clients, 
governments and regulators, business 
partners, suppliers, competitors and the 
broader community.

ii) Process of UK withdrawal from 
the EU
The manner in which the UK withdraws from 
the EU will likely have a marked impact on 
general economic conditions in the UK and 
the EU. The UK's future relationship with the 
EU and its trading relationships with the rest 
of the world could take a number of years to 
resolve. This may lead to a prolonged period 
of uncertainty, unstable economic conditions 
and market volatility, including fluctuations 
in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.

Whilst the exact impact of the UK's withdrawal 
from the EU is unknown, the Group continues 
to monitor the risks that may have a more 
immediate impact for its business, including, 
but not limited to:

■■ market volatility, including in currencies 
and interest rates, might increase which 
could have an impact on the value of the 
Group's trading book positions

■■ credit spreads could widen leading to 
reduced investor appetite for the Group's 
debt securities. This could negatively 
impact the Group's cost of and/or access 
to funding. In addition, market and interest 
rate volatility could affect the underlying 
value of assets in the banking book and 
securities held by the Group for liquidity 
purposes

■■ a credit rating agency downgrade applied 
directly to the Group, or indirectly as a 
result of a credit rating agency downgrade 
to the UK Government, could significantly 
increase the Group's cost of and/or reduce 
its access to funding, widen credit spreads 
and materially adversely affect the Group's 
interest margins and liquidity position

■■ a UK recession with lower growth, higher 
unemployment and falling UK property 
prices could lead to increased impairments 
in relation to a number of the Group's 
portfolios, including, but not limited to, 
its UK mortgage portfolio, UK unsecured 
lending portfolio (including credit cards) 
and its commercial real estate exposures

■■ the ability to attract, or prevent the 
departure of, qualified and skilled 
employees may be impacted by the UK's 
and the EU's future approach to the EU 
freedom of movement and immigration 
from the EU countries and this may impact 
the Group's access to the EU talent pool 

■■ a disorderly exit from the EU may put a 
strain on the capabilities of the Group's 
systems, increasing the risk of failure of 
those systems and potentially resulting 
in losses and reputational damage for 
the Group

Material existing and emerging 
risks to the Group's future 
performance
The Group has identified a broad range of 
risks to which its businesses are exposed. 
Material risks are those to which senior 
management pay particular attention and 
which could cause the delivery of the Group's 
strategy, results of operations, financial 
condition and/or prospects to differ materially 
from expectations. Emerging risks are those 
which have unknown components, the impact 
of which could crystallise over a longer time 
period. In addition, certain other factors 
beyond the Group's control, including 
escalation of terrorism or global conflicts, 
natural disasters, epidemic outbreaks and 
similar events, although not detailed below, 
could have a similar impact on the Group. 

Material existing and emerging 
risks potentially impacting more 
than one principal risk
i) Business conditions, general 
economy and geopolitical issues
The Group's operations are subject to 
potentially unfavourable global and local 
economic and market conditions, as well as 
geopolitical developments, which may have 
a material effect on the Group's business, 
results of operations, financial condition 
and prospects.

A deterioration in global or local economic 
and market conditions may lead to (among 
other things): (i) deteriorating business, 
consumer or investor confidence and lower 
levels of fixed asset investment and 
productivity growth, which in turn may 
lead to lower client activity, including lower 
demand for borrowing from creditworthy 
customers; (ii) higher default rates, 
delinquencies, write-offs and impairment 
charges as borrowers struggle with the 
burden of additional debt; (iii) subdued asset 
prices and payment patterns, including the 
value of any collateral held by the Group; 
(iv) mark-to-market losses in trading 
portfolios resulting from changes in factors 
such as credit ratings, share prices and 
solvency of counterparties; and (v) revisions 
to calculated expected credit losses (ECLs) 
leading to increases in impairment allowances. 
In addition, the Group's ability to borrow from 
other financial institutions or raise funding 
from external investors may be affected by 
deteriorating economic conditions and 
market disruption. 

Geopolitical events may lead to further 
financial instability and affect economic 
growth. In particular:

■■ in the UK, the decision to leave the 
European Union (EU) may give rise 
to further economic and political 
consequences including for investment 
and market confidence in the UK and 
the remainder of the EU. See ‘(ii) Process 
of UK withdrawal from the EU' below for 
further details

■■ a significant proportion of the Group's 
portfolio is located in the US, including 
a major credit card portfolio and a range 
of corporate and investment banking 
exposures. The possibility of significant 
continued changes in US policy in certain 
sectors (including trade, healthcare and 
commodities), may have an impact on the 
Group's associated portfolios. Stress in 
the US economy, weakening GDP and the 
associated exchange rate fluctuations, 
heightened trade tensions (such as the 
current dispute between the US and 
China), an unexpected rise in 
unemployment and/or an increase in 
interest rates could lead to increased levels 
of impairment, resulting in a negative 
impact on the Group's profitability

■■ global GDP growth weakened in 2019, 
as elevated policy uncertainty weighed 
on manufacturing activity and investment. 
As a result, a number of central banks, 
most notably the Federal Reserve and 
European Central Bank (ECB), pursued 
monetary easing. Growth is expected to 
stabilise in 2020, but macroeconomic risks 
remain skewed to the downside, while 
concerns around the efficacy of existing 
policy tools to counter these risks persist. 
An escalation in geopolitical tensions, 
increased use of protectionist measures or 
a disorderly withdrawal from the EU may 
negatively impact the Group's business in 
the affected regions

■■ in China the pace of credit growth remains 
a concern, given the high level of leverage 
and despite government and regulatory 
action. A stronger than expected 
slowdown could result if authorities fail to 
appropriately manage growth during the 
transition from manufacturing towards 
services and the end of the investment and 
credit-led boom. Deterioration in emerging 
markets could affect the Group if it results 
in higher impairment charges via sovereign 
or counterparty defaults.

 Material existing and emerging risks

https://home.barclays/investor-relations/reports-and-events/annual-reports/
<Page End><Page Start>
130 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2019 home.barclays/annualreport

– increasing capital, MREL or liquidity 
resources, reducing leverage and 
risk weighted assets

– restricting distributions on capital 
instruments

– modifying the terms of outstanding 
capital instruments

– modifying legal entity structure 
(including with regard to issuance 
and deployment of capital, MREL 
and funding)

– changing the Group's business mix 
or exiting other businesses

– and/or undertaking other actions 
to strengthen the Group's position.

■■ the derivatives market has been the subject 
of particular focus for regulators in recent 
years across the G20 countries and 
beyond, with regulations introduced which 
require the reporting and clearing 
of standardised over the counter (OTC) 
derivatives and the mandatory margining 
of non-cleared OTC derivatives. These 
regulations may increase costs for market 
participants, as well as reduce liquidity 
in the derivatives markets. More broadly, 
changes to the regulatory framework 
(in particular, the review of the second 
Markets in Financial Instruments Directive 
and the implementation of the Benchmarks 
Regulation) could entail significant costs 
for market participants and may have a 
significant impact on certain markets in 
which the Group operate.

■■ the Group and certain of its members 
are subject to supervisory stress testing 
exercises in a number of jurisdictions. 
These exercises currently include 
the programmes of the BoE, the European 
Banking Authority (EBA), the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and 
the Federal Reserve Board (FRB). Failure to 
meet the requirements of regulatory stress 
tests, or the failure by regulators to 
approve the stress test results and capital 
plans of the Group, could result in the 
Group or certain of its members being 
required to enhance their capital position, 
limit capital distributions or position 
additional capital in specific subsidiaries.

 For further details on the regulatory 
supervision of, and regulations 
applicable to, the Group, 
see Supervision and regulation 
on pages 204 to 210. 

In addition, changes in interest rates could 
have an adverse impact on the value of the 
securities held in the Group's liquid asset 
portfolio. Consequently, this could create 
more volatility than expected through the 
Group's FVOCI reserves.

iv) The competitive environments of the 
banking and financial services industry
The Group's businesses are conducted in 
competitive environments (in particular, in the 
UK and US), with increased competition 
scrutiny, and the Group's financial 
performance depends upon the Group's ability 
to respond effectively to competitive pressures 
whether due to competitor behaviour, new 
entrants to the market, consumer demand, 
technological changes or otherwise.

This competitive environment, and the 
Group's response to it, may have a material 
adverse effect on the Group's ability to 
maintain existing or capture additional market 
share, business, results of operations, financial 
condition and prospects.

v) Regulatory change agenda and 
impact on business model
The Group remains subject to ongoing 
significant levels of regulatory change and 
scrutiny in many of the countries in which it 
operates (including, in particular, the UK and 
the US). As a result, regulatory risk will remain 
a focus for senior management. Furthermore, 
a more intensive regulatory approach and 
enhanced requirements together with the 
potential lack of international regulatory 
co-ordination as enhanced supervisory 
standards are developed and implemented 
may adversely affect the Group's business, 
capital and risk management strategies and/
or may result in the Group deciding to modify 
its legal entity, capital and funding structures 
and business mix, or to exit certain business 
activities altogether or not to expand in areas 
despite otherwise attractive potential.

There are several significant pieces of 
legislation and areas of focus which will 
require significant management attention, 
cost and resource, including:

■■ changes in prudential requirements may 
impact minimum requirements for own 
funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) 
(including requirements for internal MREL), 
leverage, liquidity or funding requirements, 
applicable buffers and/or add-ons to such 
minimum requirements and risk weighted 
assets calculation methodologies all as 
may be set by international, EU or national 
authorities. Such or similar changes to 
prudential requirements or additional 
supervisory and prudential expectations, 
either individually or in aggregate, may 
result in, among other things, a need for 
further management actions to meet the 
changed requirements, such as: 

■■ changes to current EU ‘Passporting' rights 
may require further adjustment to the 
current model for the Group's cross-border 
banking operation which could increase 
operational complexity and/or costs for 
the Group

■■ the legal framework within which the 
Group operates could change and become 
more uncertain if the UK takes steps to 
replace or repeal certain laws currently in 
force, which are based on EU legislation 
and regulation (including EU regulation 
of the banking sector) following its 
withdrawal from the EU. Certainty around 
the ability to maintain existing contracts, 
enforceability of certain legal obligations 
and uncertainty around the jurisdiction 
of the UK courts may be affected until 
the impacts of the loss of the current legal 
and regulatory arrangements between the 
UK and EU and the enforceability of UK 
judgements across the EU are fully known

■■ should the UK see reduced access to 
financial markets infrastructures (including 
exchanges, central counterparties and 
payments services, or other support 
services provided by third party suppliers) 
service provision for clients could be 
impacted, likely resulting in reduced 
market share and revenue and increased 
operating costs for the Group.

iii) The impact of interest rate changes 
on the Group's profitability
Any changes to interest rates are significant 
for the Group, especially given the uncertainty 
as to the direction of interest rates and the 
pace at which interest rates may change, 
particularly in the Group's main markets 
of the UK and the US. 

A continued period of low interest rates and 
flat yield curves, including any further cuts, 
may affect and continue to put pressure on 
the Group's net interest margins (the 
difference between its lending income and 
borrowing costs) and could adversely affect 
the profitability and prospects of the Group.

However, whilst interest rate rises could 
positively impact the Group's profitability 
as retail and corporate business income 
increases due to margin de-compression, 
further increases in interest rates, if larger 
or more frequent than expected, could lead 
to generally weaker than expected growth, 
reduced business confidence and higher 
unemployment, which in turn could cause 
stress in the lending portfolio and 
underwriting activity of the Group. Resultant 
higher credit losses driving an increased 
impairment charge would most notably 
impact retail unsecured portfolios and 
wholesale non-investment grade lending and 
could have a material effect on the Group's 
business, results of operations, financial 
condition and prospects.

vi) The impact of climate change 
on the Group's business
The risks associated with climate change are 
subject to rapidly increasing societal, 
regulatory and political focus, both in the UK 
and internationally. Embedding climate risk 
into the Group's risk framework in line with 
regulatory expectations, and adapting the 
Group's operations and business strategy to 
address both the financial risks resulting from: 
(i) the physical risk of climate change; and 
(ii) the risk from the transition to a low-carbon 
economy, could have a significant impact on 
the Group's business.

Physical risks from climate change arise from 
a number of factors and relate to specific 
weather events and longer-term shifts in the 
climate. The nature and timing of extreme 
weather events are uncertain but they are 
increasing in frequency and their impact on 
the economy is predicted to be more acute 
in the future. The potential impact on the 
economy includes, but is not limited to, 
lower GDP growth, higher unemployment 
and significant changes in asset prices and 
profitability of industries. Damage to the 
properties and operations of borrowers could 
impair asset values and the creditworthiness 
of customers leading to increased default 
rates, delinquencies, write-offs and 
impairment charges in the Group's portfolios. 
In addition, the Group's premises and 
resilience may also suffer physical damage 
due to weather events leading to increased 
costs for the Group.

As the economy transitions to a low-carbon 
economy, financial institutions such as the 
Group may face significant and rapid 
developments in stakeholder expectations, 
policy, law and regulation which could impact 
the lending activities the Group undertakes, as 
well as the risks associated with its lending 
portfolios, and the value of the Group's 
financial assets. As sentiment towards climate 
change shifts and societal preferences 
change, the Group may face greater scrutiny 
of the type of business it conducts, adverse 
media coverage and reputational damage, 
which may in turn impact customer demand 
for the Group's products, returns on certain 
business activities and the value of certain 
assets and trading positions resulting in 
impairment charges.

In addition, the impacts of physical and 
transition climate risks can lead to second 
order connected risks, which have the 
potential to affect the Group's retail and 
wholesale portfolios. The impacts of climate 
change may increase losses for those sectors 
sensitive to the effects of physical and 
transition risks. Any subsequent increase in 
defaults and rising unemployment could 
create recessionary pressures, which may lead 
to wider deterioration in the creditworthiness 
of the Group's clients, higher ECLs, and 
increased charge-offs and defaults among 
retail customers.

If the Group does not adequately embed risks 
associated with climate change into its risk 
framework to appropriately measure, manage 
and disclose the various financial and 
operational risks it faces as a result of climate 
change, or fails to adapt its strategy and 
business model to the changing regulatory 
requirements and market expectations on a 
timely basis, it may have a material and 
adverse impact on the Group's level of 
business growth, competitiveness, profitability, 
capital requirements, cost of funding, and 
financial condition.

For further details on the Group's 
approach to climate change, see page 
138 of climate change risk 
management.

vii) Impact of benchmark interest rate 
reforms on the Group
For several years, global regulators and central 
banks have been driving international efforts 
to reform key benchmark interest rates and 
indices, such as the London Interbank Offered 
Rate (LIBOR), which are used to determine the 
amounts payable under a wide range of 
transactions and make them more reliable and 
robust. This has resulted in significant 
changes to the methodology and operation of 
certain benchmarks and indices, the adoption 
of alternative ‘risk-free' reference rates and the 
proposed discontinuation of certain reference 
rates (including LIBOR), with further changes 
anticipated.

Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential 
changes, the availability and/or suitability 
of alternative ‘risk-free' reference rates and 
other reforms may adversely affect a broad 
range of transactions (including any securities, 
loans and derivatives which use LIBOR to 
determine the amount of interest payable that 
are included in the Group's financial assets 
and liabilities) that use these reference rates 
and indices and introduce a number of risks 
for the Group, including, but not limited to:

■■ Conduct risk: in undertaking actions to 
transition away from using certain 
reference rates (including LIBOR), the 
Group faces conduct risks, which may 
lead to customer complaints, regulatory 
sanctions or reputational impact if the 
Group is (i) considered to be undertaking 
market activities that are manipulative or 
create a false or misleading impression, 
(ii) misusing sensitive information or not 
identifying or appropriately managing 
or mitigating conflicts of interest, 
(iii) providing customers with inadequate 
advice, misleading information, unsuitable 
products or unacceptable service, (iv) not 
taking an appropriate or consistent 
response to remediation activity or 
customer complaints, (v) providing 
regulators with inaccurate regulatory 
reporting or (vi) colluding or 
inappropriately sharing information 
with competitors

As the economy 
transitions to a low-
carbon economy, 
financial institutions 
such as the Group may 
face significant and 
rapid developments in 
policy, law and 
regulation which could 
impact the lending 
activities the Group 
undertakes.

RISK REVIEW

 Material existing and emerging risks

The SRR consists of five stabilisation options: 
(i) private sector transfer of all or part of the 
business or shares of the relevant entity, (ii) 
transfer of all or part of the business of the 
relevant entity to a ‘bridge bank' established 
by the Bank of England, (iii) transfer to an 
asset management vehicle wholly or partly 
owned by HM Treasury or the Bank of 
England, (iv) the cancellation or transfer of the 
relevant entities' equity and write-down or 
conversion of the relevant entity's capital 
instruments and liabilities (the bail-in tool) 
and (v) temporary public ownership (i.e. 
nationalisation). 

In addition, the relevant UK resolution 
authority may, in certain circumstances, 
in accordance with the Banking Act require 
the permanent write-down or conversion 
into equity of any outstanding tier 1 capital 
instruments and tier 2 capital instruments 
prior to the exercise of any stabilisation option 
(including the bail-in tool), which may lead 
to the cancellation, transfer or dilution of 
Barclays PLC's ordinary share capital.

Shareholders should assume that, in a 
resolution situation, public financial support 
will only be available to a relevant entity as 
a last resort after the relevant UK resolution 
authorities have assessed and used, to the 
maximum extent practicable, the resolution 
tools, including the bail-in tool (the Bank of 
England's preferred approach for the 
resolution of the Group is a bail-in strategy 
with a single point of entry at Barclays PLC). 
The exercise of any of such powers under the 
Banking Act or any suggestion of any such 
exercise could materially adversely affect the 
value of Barclays PLC ordinary shares and 
could lead to shareholders losing some or all 
of their investment.

In addition, any safeguards within the Banking 
Act (such as the ‘no creditor worse off ' 
principle) may not result in compensation 
to shareholders that is equivalent to the full 
losses incurred by them in the resolution and 
there can be no assurance that shareholders 
would recover such compensation promptly.

■■ Financial risks: the valuation of certain of 
the Group's financial assets and liabilities 
may change. Moreover, transitioning to 
alternative ‘risk-free' reference rates may 
impact the ability of members of the Group 
to calculate and model amounts receivable 
by them on certain financial assets and 
determine the amounts payable on certain 
financial liabilities (such as debt securities 
issued by them) because currently 
alternative ‘risk-free' reference rates 
(such as the Sterling Overnight Index 
Average (SONIA) and the Secured 
Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR)) are 
look-back rates whereas term rates (such 
as LIBOR) allow borrowers to calculate at 
the start of any interest period exactly how 
much is payable at the end of such interest 
period. This may have a material adverse 
effect on the Group's cash flows

■■ Pricing risk: changes to existing reference 
rates and indices, discontinuation of any 
reference rate or indices and transition to 
alternative ‘risk-free' reference rates may 
impact the pricing mechanisms used by 
the Group on certain transactions

■■ Operational risk: changes to existing 
reference rates and indices, 
discontinuation of any reference rate 
or index and transition to alternative 
‘risk-free' reference rates may require 
changes to the Group's IT systems, trade 
reporting infrastructure, operational 
processes, and controls. In addition, if any 
reference rate or index (such as LIBOR) is 
no longer available to calculate amounts 
payable, the Group may incur additional 
expenses in amending documentation 
for new and existing transactions and/or 
effecting the transition from the original 
reference rate or index to a new reference 
rate or index

■■ Accounting risk: an inability to apply 
hedge accounting in accordance with IFRS 
could lead to increased volatility in the 
Group's financial results and performance.

Any of these factors may have a material 
adverse effect on the Group's business, 
results of operations, financial condition 
and prospects.

For further details on the impacts of 
benchmark interest rate reforms on 
the Group, see Note 14 on pages 
270 to 277.

viii) Holding company structure of 
Barclays PLC and its dependency 
on distributions from its subsidiaries
Barclays PLC is a holding company and its 
principal sources of income are, and are 
expected to continue to be, distributions 
(in the form of dividends and interest 
payments) from operating subsidiaries which 
also hold the principal assets of the Group. 
As a separate legal entity, Barclays PLC relies 
on such distributions in order to be able to 
meet its obligations as they fall due (including 
its payment obligations with respect to its 
debt securities) and to create distributable 
reserves for payment of dividends to 
ordinary shareholders. 

The ability of Barclays PLC's subsidiaries to 
pay dividends and interest and Barclays PLC's 
ability to receive such distributions from its 
investments in its subsidiaries and other 
entities will be subject not only to such 
subsidiaries' and other entities' financial 
performance but also to applicable local 
laws and other restrictions. These laws and 
restrictions could limit the payment of 
dividends and distributions to Barclays PLC 
by its subsidiaries and any other entities in 
which it holds an investment from time to 
time, which could restrict Barclays PLC's 
ability to meet its obligations and/or to pay 
dividends to ordinary shareholders.

ix) Application of resolution measures 
and stabilisation powers under the 
Banking Act
Under the Banking Act 2009, as amended, 
(the ‘Banking Act') substantial powers are 
granted to the Bank of England (or, in certain 
circumstances, HM Treasury), in consultation 
with the PRA, the FCA and HM Treasury, as 
appropriate, as part of a special resolution 
regime (the ‘SRR'). These powers enable the 
relevant UK resolution authority to implement 
resolution measures and stabilisation options 
with respect to a UK bank or investment firm 
and certain of its affiliates (currently including 
Barclays PLC) (each a ‘relevant entity') in 
circumstances in which the relevant UK 
resolution authority is satisfied that the 
resolution conditions are met.

The Group also has large individual exposures 
to single name counterparties, both in its 
lending activities and in its financial services 
and trading activities, including transactions 
in derivatives and transactions with brokers, 
central clearing houses, dealers, other banks, 
mutual and hedge funds and other 
institutional clients. The default of such 
counterparties could have a significant 
impact on the carrying value of these assets. 
In addition, where such counterparty risk has 
been mitigated by taking collateral, credit risk 
may remain high if the collateral held cannot 
be realised, or has to be liquidated at prices 
which are insufficient to recover the full 
amount of the loan or derivative exposure. 
Any such defaults could have a material 
adverse effect on the Group's results due to, 
for example, increased credit losses and 
higher impairment charges.

 For further details on the Group's 
approach to credit risk, see credit risk 
management on pages 139 to 140 
and credit risk performance on pages 
148 to 175.

ii) Market risk
Market risk is the risk of loss arising from 
potential adverse change in the value of the 
Group's assets and liabilities from fluctuation 
in market variables including, but not limited 
to, interest rates, foreign exchange, equity 
prices, commodity prices, credit spreads, 
implied volatilities and asset correlations. 

A broadening in trade tensions between the 
US and its major trading partners, slowing 
global growth and political concerns in the US 
and Europe (including Brexit) are some of the 
factors that could heighten market risks for 
the Group's portfolios. In addition, the Group's 
trading business is generally exposed to a 
prolonged period of elevated asset price 
volatility, particularly if it negatively affects the 
depth of marketplace liquidity. Such a scenario 
could impact the Group's ability to execute 
client trades and may also result in lower client 
flow-driven income and/or market-based 
losses on its existing portfolio of market risks. 
These can include having to absorb higher 
hedging costs from rebalancing risks that 
need to be managed dynamically as market 
levels and their associated volatilities change.

It is difficult to predict changes in market 
conditions, and such changes could have a 
material adverse effect on the Group's 
business, results of operations, financial 
condition and prospects.

 For further details on the Group's 
approach to market risk, see market 
risk management on page 141 and 
market risk performance on pages 176  
to 177.

b) Specific sectors and concentrations
The Group is subject to risks arising from 
changes in credit quality and recovery rates 
of loans and advances due from borrowers 
and counterparties in any specific portfolio. 
Any deterioration in credit quality could lead 
to lower recoverability and higher impairment 
in a specific sector. The following are areas 
of uncertainties to the Group's portfolio which 
could have a material impact on performance:

■■ UK retail, hospitality & leisure. Softening 
demand, rising costs and a structural shift 
to online shopping is fuelling pressure 
on the UK High Street and other sectors 
heavily reliant on consumer discretionary 
spending. As these sectors continue to 
reposition themselves, the trend represents 
a potential risk in the Group's UK corporate 
portfolio from the perspective of its 
interactions with both retailers and 
their landlords

■■ consumer affordability has remained a 
key area of focus, particularly in unsecured 
lending. Macroeconomic factors, such 
as rising unemployment, that impact a 
customer's ability to service unsecured 
debt payments could lead to increased 
arrears in unsecured products

■■ UK real estate market. UK property 
represents a significant portion of the 
overall Group retail and corporate credit 
exposure. In 2019, property price growth 
across the UK has slowed, particularly 
in London and the South East where the 
Group's exposure has high concentration. 
The Group is at risk of increased 
impairment from a material fall in 
property prices

■■ leverage finance underwriting. The Group 
takes on sub-investment grade 
underwriting exposure, including single 
name risk, particularly in the US and 
Europe. The Group is exposed to credit 
events and market volatility during the 
underwriting period. Any adverse events 
during this period may potentially result in 
loss for the Group, or an increased capital 
requirement should there be a need to 
hold the exposure for an extended period

■■ Italian mortgage portfolio. The Group is 
exposed to a decline in the Italian 
economic environment through a 
mortgage portfolio in run-off and positions 
to wholesale customers. Growth in the 
Italian economy remained weak in 2019 
and should the economy deteriorate 
further, there could be a material adverse 
effect on the Group's results including, but 
not limited to, increased credit losses and 
higher impairment charges.

Material existing and emerging 
risks impacting individual 
principal risks

i) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of loss to the Group 
from the failure of clients, customers or 
counterparties, including sovereigns, to fully 
honour their obligations to members of 
the Group, including the whole and timely 
payment of principal, interest, collateral and 
other receivables.

a) Impairment
The introduction of the impairment 
requirements of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, 
resulted in impairment loss allowances that 
are recognised earlier, on a more forward-
looking basis and on a broader scope of 
financial instruments, and may continue 
to have a material impact on the Group's 
business, results of operations, financial 
condition and prospects.

Measurement involves complex judgement 
and impairment charges could be volatile, 
particularly under stressed conditions. 
Unsecured products with longer expected 
lives, such as credit cards, are the most 
impacted. Taking into account the transitional 
regime, the capital treatment on the increased 
reserves has the potential to adversely impact 
the Group's regulatory capital ratios.

In addition, the move from incurred losses to 
ECLs has the potential to impact the Group's 
performance under stressed economic 
conditions or regulatory stress tests. 

For more information, refer to Note 1 
on pages 248 to 252.

RISK REVIEW

 Material existing and emerging risks

c) Interest rate risk in the banking book 
Interest rate risk in the banking book is the 
risk that the Group is exposed to capital or 
income volatility because of a mismatch 
between the interest rate exposures of its 
(non-traded) assets and liabilities. The Group's 
hedge programmes for interest rate risk in the 
banking book rely on behavioural assumptions 
and, as a result, the success of the hedging 
strategy cannot be guaranteed. A potential 
mismatch in the balance or duration of the 
hedge assumptions could lead to earnings 
deterioration. A decline in interest rates in 
G3 currencies may also compress net interest 
margin on retail portfolios. In addition, the 
Group's liquidity pool is exposed to potential 
capital and/or income volatility due to 
movements in market rates and prices. 

 For further details on the Group's 
approach to treasury and capital risk, 
see treasury and capital risk 
management on pages 142 to 143 and 
treasury and capital risk performance 
on pages 178 to 199.

iv) Operational risk
Operational risk is the risk of loss to the 
Group from inadequate or failed processes 
or systems, human factors or due to external 
events where the root cause is not due to 
credit or market risks. Examples include: 

a) Operational resilience
The loss of or disruption to business 
processing is a material inherent risk within 
the Group and across the financial services 
industry, whether arising through impacts 
on the Group's technology systems, real estate 
services including its retail branch network, 
or availability of personnel or services supplied 
by third parties. Failure to build resilience and 
recovery capabilities into business processes 
or into the services of technology, real estate 
or suppliers on which the Group's business 
processes depend, may result in significant 
customer detriment, costs to reimburse losses 
incurred by the Group's customers, and 
reputational damage.

iii) Treasury and capital risk
There are three primary types of treasury 
and capital risk faced by the Group:

a) Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group is 
unable to meet its contractual or contingent 
obligations or that it does not have the 
appropriate amount, tenor and composition 
of funding and liquidity to support its assets. 
This could cause the Group to fail to meet 
regulatory liquidity standards or be unable 
to support day-to-day banking activities. 
Key liquidity risks that the Group faces include:

■■ the stability of the Group's current 
funding profile: in particular, that part 
which is based on accounts and deposits 
payable on demand or at short notice, 
could be affected by the Group failing 
to preserve the current level of customer 
and investor confidence. The Group 
also regularly accesses the money and 
capital markets to provide short-term 
and long-term funding to support its 
operations. Several factors, including 
adverse macroeconomic conditions, 
adverse outcomes in conduct and legal, 
competition and regulatory matters 
and loss of confidence by investors, 
counterparties and/or customers in the 
Group, can affect the ability of the Group 
to access the capital markets and/or the 
cost and other terms upon which the 
Group is able to obtain market funding

■■ credit rating changes and the impact on 
funding costs: rating agencies regularly 
review credit ratings given to Barclays PLC 
and certain members of the Group. Credit 
ratings are based on a number of factors, 
including some which are not within the 
Group's control (such as political and 
regulatory developments, changes in 
rating methodologies, macro-economic 
conditions and the sovereign credit ratings 
of the countries in which the Group 
operates)

  Whilst the impact of a credit rating 
change will depend on a number of 
factors (including the type of issuance 
and prevailing market conditions), any 
reductions in a credit rating (in particular, 
any downgrade below investment grade) 
may affect the Group's access to the 
money or capital markets and/or terms 
on which the Group is able to obtain 
market funding, increase costs of funding 
and credit spreads, reduce the size of the 
Group's deposit base, trigger additional 
collateral or other requirements in 
derivative contracts and other secured 
funding arrangements or limit the range 
of counterparties who are willing to enter 
into transactions with the Group. Any of 
these factors could have a material 
adverse effect on the Group's business, 
results of operations, financial condition 
and prospects.

b) Capital risk 
Capital risk is the risk that the Group has an 
insufficient level or composition of capital to 
support its normal business activities and to 
meet its regulatory capital requirements under 
normal operating environments or stressed 
conditions (both actual and as defined for 
internal planning or regulatory stress testing 
purposes). This includes the risk from the 
Group's pension plans. Key capital risks that 
the Group faces include:

■■ failure to meet prudential capital 
requirements: this could lead to the Group 
being unable to support some or all of its 
business activities, a failure to pass 
regulatory stress tests, increased cost of 
funding due to deterioration in investor 
appetite or credit ratings, restrictions on 
distributions including the ability to meet 
dividend targets, and/or the need to take 
additional measures to strengthen the 
Group's capital or leverage position

■■ adverse changes in FX rates impacting 
capital ratios: the Group has capital 
resources, risk weighted assets and 
leverage exposures denominated in foreign 
currencies. Changes in foreign currency 
exchange rates may adversely impact the 
Sterling equivalent value of these items. 
As a result, the Group's regulatory capital 
ratios are sensitive to foreign currency 
movements. Failure to appropriately 
manage the Group's balance sheet to take 
account of foreign currency movements 
could result in an adverse impact on 
the Group's regulatory capital and 
leverage ratios

■■ adverse movements in the pension fund: 
adverse movements in pension assets 
and liabilities for defined benefit pension 
schemes could result in deficits on a 
funding and/or accounting basis. This 
could lead to the Group making substantial 
additional contributions to its pension 
plans and/or a deterioration in its capital 
position. Under IAS 19, the liabilities 
discount rate is derived from the yields of 
high quality corporate bonds. Therefore, 
the valuation of the Group's defined 
benefits schemes would be adversely 
affected by a prolonged fall in the discount 
rate due to a persistent low interest rate 
and/or credit spread environment. Inflation 
is another significant risk driver to the 
pension fund as the liabilities are adversely 
impacted by an increase in long-term 
inflation expectations.

b) Cyberthreats
The frequency of cyberattacks continues 
to grow and is a global threat that is inherent 
across all industries. The financial sector 
remains a primary target for cyber criminals, 
hostile nation states, opportunists and 
hacktivists and there is an increasing level 
of sophistication in criminal hacking for 
the purpose of stealing money, stealing, 
destroying or manipulating data (including 
customer data) and/or disrupting operations, 
where multiple threats exist including threats 
arising from malicious emails, distributed 
denial of service (DDoS) attacks, payment 
system compromises, insider attackers, 
supply chain and vulnerability exploitation. 
Cyber events have a compounding impact 
on services and customers, e.g. data breaches 
in social networking sites, retail companies 
and payments networks. 

Any failure in the Group's cybersecurity 
policies, procedures or controls and/or its IT 
systems, may result in significant financial 
losses, major business disruption, inability 
to deliver customer services, or loss of data 
or other sensitive information (including as a 
result of an outage) and may cause associated 
reputational damage. Any of these factors 
could increase costs (including, but not 
limited to, costs relating to notification of, 
or compensation for customers) or may 
affect the Group's ability to retain and attract 
customers. Regulators in the UK, US and Europe 
continue to recognise cybersecurity as an 
increasing systemic risk to the financial sector 
and have highlighted the need for financial 
institutions to improve their monitoring and 
control of, and resilience (particularly of critical 
services) to cyberattacks, and to provide 
timely notification of them, as appropriate. 
Given the Group's reliance on technology, a 
cyberattack could have a material adverse 
effect on its business, results of operations, 
financial condition and prospects.

For further details on the Group's 
approach to cyberthreats, see 
operational risk performance on  
pages 200 to 202.

c) New and emergent technology
Technological advancements present 
opportunities to develop new and innovative 
ways of doing business across the Group, with 
new solutions being developed both in-house 
and in association with third party companies. 
Introducing new forms of technology, 
however, also has the potential to increase 
inherent risk. Failure to evaluate, actively 
manage and closely monitor risk exposure 
during all phases of business development 
could introduce new vulnerabilities and 
security flaws and have a material adverse 
effect on the Group's business, results of 
operations, financial condition and prospects.

d) External fraud 
The level and nature of fraud threats continue 
to evolve, particularly with the increasing use 
of digital products and the greater 
functionality available online. Criminals 
continue to adapt their techniques and are 
increasingly focused on targeting customers 
and clients through ever more sophisticated 
methods of social engineering. External data 
breaches also provide criminals with the 
opportunity to exploit the growing levels of 
compromised data. These fraud threats could 
lead to customer detriment, loss of business, 
missed business opportunity and reputational 
damage, all of which could have a material 
adverse effect on the Group's business, results 
of operations, financial condition and 
prospects. Furthermore, recent changes in the 
regulatory landscape has seen increased levels 
of liability being taken by the Group as part of 
a voluntary code in the UK to provide 
additional protection to customers and clients 
who are victims of Authorised Push Payment 
scams. 

e) Data management and information 
protection 
The Group holds and processes large volumes 
of data, including personally identifiable 
information, intellectual property, and financial 
data. The General Data Protection Regulation 
(GDPR) has strengthened the data protection 
rights of customers and increased the 
accountability of the Group in its management 
of such data. Failure to accurately collect and 
maintain this data, protect it from breaches 
of confidentiality and interference with its 
availability exposes the Group to the risk of 
loss or unavailability of data (including 
customer data discussed under ‘vi) Conduct 
risk, c) Data protection and privacy' below) 
or data integrity issues. Any of these failures 
could have a material adverse effect on 
the Group's business, results of operations, 
financial condition and prospects.

f ) Algorithmic trading
In some areas of the investment banking 
business, trading algorithms are used to 
price and risk manage client and principal 
transactions. An algorithmic error could result 
in erroneous or duplicated transactions, a 
system outage, or impact the Group's pricing 
abilities, which could have a material adverse 
effect on the Group's business, results of 
operations, financial condition and prospects 
and reputation. 

g) Processing error
As a large, complex financial institution, 
the Group faces the risk of material errors 
in existing operational processes, or from 
new processes as a result of ongoing 
change activity, including payments and client 
transactions. Material operational or payment 
errors could disadvantage the Group's 
customers, clients or counterparties and 
could have a material adverse effect on the 
Group's business, results of operations, 
financial condition and prospects.

h) Supplier exposure
The Group depends on suppliers for the 
provision of many of its services and the 
development of technology. Whilst the 
Group depends on suppliers, it remains fully 
accountable for any risk arising from the 
actions of suppliers. The dependency on 
suppliers and sub-contracting of outsourced 
services introduces concentration risk where 
the failure of specific suppliers could have 
an impact on the Group's ability to continue 
to provide material services to its customers. 
Failure to adequately manage supplier risk 
could have a material adverse effect on 
the Group's business, results of operations, 
financial condition and prospects.

RISK REVIEW

 Material existing and emerging risks

vi) Conduct risk
Conduct risk is the risk of detriment to 
customers, clients, market integrity, effective 
competition or the Group from the 
inappropriate supply of financial services, 
including instances of wilful or negligent 
misconduct. This risk could manifest itself 
in a variety of ways:

a) Employee misconduct
The Group's businesses are exposed to risk 
from potential non-compliance with its 
policies and instances of wilful and negligent 
misconduct by employees, all of which could 
result in enforcement action or reputational 
harm. It is not always possible to deter 
employee misconduct, and the precautions 
we take to prevent and detect this activity may 
not always be effective. Employee misconduct 
could have a material adverse effect on the 
Group's customers, clients, market integrity 
as well as reputation, financial condition 
and prospects.

b) Product governance and life cycle
The ongoing review, management and 
governance of new and amended products 
has come under increasing regulatory focus 
(for example, the recast of the Markets in 
Financial Instruments Directive and guidance 
in relation to the adoption of the EU 
Benchmarks Regulation) and the Group 
expects this to continue. The following could 
lead to poor customer outcomes: 
(i) ineffective product governance, including 
design, approval and review of products, 
and (ii) inappropriate controls over internal 
and third party sales channels and post sales 
services, such as complaints handling, 
collections and recoveries. The Group is at 
risk of financial loss and reputational damage 
as a result.

c) Financial crime
The Group may be adversely affected if it fails 
to effectively mitigate the risk that third parties 
or its employees facilitate, or that its products 
and services are used to facilitate, financial 
crime (money laundering, terrorist financing 
and proliferation financing, breaches of 
economic and financial sanctions, bribery and 
corruption, and the facilitation of tax evasion). 
UK and US regulations covering financial 
institutions continue to focus on combating 
financial crime. Failure to comply may lead to 
enforcement action by the Group's regulators, 
including severe penalties, which may have 
a material adverse effect on the Group's 
business, financial condition and prospects.

i) Critical accounting estimates 
and judgements
The preparation of financial statements 
in accordance with IFRS requires the use 
of estimates. It also requires management 
to exercise judgement in applying relevant 
accounting policies. The key areas involving 
a higher degree of judgement or complexity, 
or areas where assumptions are significant 
to the consolidated and individual financial 
statements, include credit impairment charges 
for amortised cost assets, taxes, fair value of 
financial instruments, pensions and post-
retirement benefits, and provisions including 
conduct and legal, competition and regulatory 
matters. There is a risk that if the judgement 
exercised, or the estimates or assumptions 
used, subsequently turn out to be incorrect, 
this could result in material losses to the 
Group, beyond what was anticipated or 
provided for. Further development of 
standards and interpretations under IFRS 
could also materially impact the financial 
results, condition and prospects of the Group. 

For further details on the accounting 
estimates and policies, see the Notes 
to the audited financial statements 
on pages 248 to 337.

j) Tax risk
The Group is required to comply with the 
domestic and international tax laws and 
practice of all countries in which it has 
business operations. There is a risk that the 
Group could suffer losses due to additional tax 
charges, other financial costs or reputational 
damage as a result of failing to comply with 
such laws and practice, or by failing to 
manage its tax affairs in an appropriate 
manner, with much of this risk attributable 
to the international structure of the Group. 
In addition, increasing reporting and 
disclosure requirements around the world 
and the digitisation of the administration of 
tax has potential to increase the Group's tax 
compliance obligations further.

k) Ability to hire and retain appropriately 
qualified employees
As a regulated financial institution, the Group 
requires diversified and specialist skilled 
colleagues. The Group's ability to attract, 
develop and retain a diverse mix of talent is 
key to the delivery of its core business activity 
and strategy. 

This is impacted by a range of external and 
internal factors, such as the UK's decision to 
leave the EU and the enhanced individual 
accountability applicable to the banking 
industry. Failure to attract or prevent the 
departure of appropriately qualified and skilled 
employees could have a material adverse 
effect on the Group's business, results of 
operations, financial condition and prospects. 
Additionally, this may result in disruption to 
service which could in turn lead to 
disenfranchising certain customer groups, 
customer detriment and reputational damage.

 For further details on the Group's 
approach to operational risk, see 
operational risk management on 
pages 143 to 144 and operational risk 
performance on pages 200 to 202.

v) Model risk
Model risk is the risk of potential adverse 
consequences from financial assessments or 
decisions based on incorrect or misused model 
outputs and reports. The Group relies on 
models to support a broad range of business 
and risk management activities, including 
informing business decisions and strategies, 
measuring and limiting risk, valuing exposures 
(including the calculation of impairment), 
conducting stress testing, assessing capital 
adequacy, supporting new business 
acceptance and risk and reward evaluation, 
managing client assets, and meeting reporting 
requirements. Models are, by their nature, 
imperfect and incomplete representations of 
reality because they rely on assumptions and 
inputs, and so they may be subject to errors 
affecting the accuracy of their outputs. For 
instance, the quality of the data used in models 
across the Group has a material impact on 
the accuracy and completeness of its risk and 
financial metrics. Models may also be misused. 
Model errors or misuse may result in (among 
other things) the Group making inappropriate 
business decisions and/or inaccuracies or 
errors being identified in the Group's risk 
management and regulatory reporting 
processes. This could result in significant 
financial loss, imposition of additional 
capital requirements, enhanced regulatory 
supervision and reputational damage, all of 
which could have a material adverse effect 
on the Group's business, results of operations, 
financial condition and prospects.

For further details on the Group's 
approach to model risk, see model risk 
management on page 144 and model 
risk performance on page 203.

d) Data protection and privacy
Proper handling of personal data is critical 
to sustaining long-term relationships with our 
customers and clients and complying with 
privacy laws and regulations. Failure to protect 
personal data can lead to potential detriment 
to our customers and clients, reputational 
damage, enforcement action and financial 
loss, which may be substantial (see ‘iv) 
Operational risk, (e) Data management and 
information protection' above).

e) Regulatory focus on culture 
and accountability
Regulators around the world continue to 
emphasise the importance of culture and 
personal accountability and enforce the 
adoption of adequate internal reporting 
and whistleblowing procedures to help to 
promote appropriate conduct and drive 
positive outcomes for customers, colleagues, 
clients and markets. The requirements and 
expectations of the UK Senior Managers 
Regime, Certification Regime and Conduct 
Rules have driven additional accountabilities 
for individuals across the Group with an 
increased focus on governance and rigour. 
Failure to meet these requirements and 
expectations may lead to regulatory sanctions, 
both for the individuals and the Group.

 For further details on the Group's 
approach to conduct risk, see conduct 
risk management on page 145 
and conduct risk performance on  
page 203.

vii) Reputation risk
Reputation risk is the risk that an action, 
transaction, investment, event, decision or 
business relationship will reduce trust in the 
Group's integrity and/or competence. 

Any material lapse in standards of integrity, 
compliance, customer service or operating 
efficiency may represent a potential reputation 
risk. Stakeholder expectations constantly 
evolve, and so reputation risk is dynamic and 
varies between geographical regions, groups 
and individuals. A risk arising in one business 
area can have an adverse effect upon the 
Group's overall reputation and any one 
transaction, investment or event (in the 
perception of key stakeholders) can reduce 
trust in the Group's integrity and competence. 
The Group's association with sensitive topics 
and sectors has been, and in some instances 
continues to be, an area of concern for 
stakeholders, including (i) the financing of, 
and investments in, businesses which 
operate in sectors that are sensitive because 
of their relative carbon intensity or local 
environmental impact; (ii) potential 
association with human rights violations 
(including combating modern slavery) in the 

Group's operations or supply chain and by 
clients and customers; and (iii) the financing 
of businesses which manufacture and export 
military and riot control goods and services.

Reputation risk could also arise from negative 
public opinion about the actual, or perceived, 
manner in which the Group conducts its 
business activities, or the Group's financial 
performance, as well as actual or perceived 
practices in banking and the financial services 
industry generally. Modern technologies, 
in particular online social media channels 
and other broadcast tools that facilitate 
communication with large audiences in short 
time frames and with minimal costs, may 
significantly enhance and accelerate the 
distribution and effect of damaging 
information and allegations. Negative public 
opinion may adversely affect the Group's 
ability to retain and attract customers, in 
particular, corporate and retail depositors, 
and to retain and motivate staff, and could 
have a material adverse effect on the Group's 
business, results of operations, financial 
condition and prospects.

In addition to the above, reputation risk has 
the potential to arise from operational issues 
or conduct matters which cause detriment to 
customers, clients, market integrity, effective 
competition or the Group (see ‘iv) Operational 
risk' above). 

 For further details on the Group's 
approach to reputation risk, see 
reputation risk management on page 
145 and reputation risk performance 
on page 203.

viii) Legal risk and legal, competition 
and regulatory matters
The Group conducts activities in a highly 
regulated global market which exposes it and 
its employees to legal risk arising from (i) the 
multitude of laws and regulations that apply 
to the businesses it operates, which are highly 
dynamic, may vary between jurisdictions, and 
are often unclear in their application to 
particular circumstances especially in new and 
emerging areas; and (ii) the diversified and 
evolving nature of the Group's businesses and 
business practices. In each case, this exposes 
the Group and its employees to the risk of loss 
or the imposition of penalties, damages or 
fines from the failure of members of the 
Group to meet their respective legal 
obligations, including legal or contractual 
requirements. Legal risk may arise in relation 
to a number of the risk factors identified 
above, including (without limitation) as a 
result of (i) the UK's withdrawal from the EU, 
(ii) benchmark reform, (iii) the regulatory 
change agenda, and (iv) rapidly evolving rules 
and regulations in relation to data protection, 
privacy and cybersecurity.

A breach of applicable legislation and/or 
regulations by the Group or its employees 
could result in criminal prosecution, regulatory 
censure, potentially significant fines and other 
sanctions in the jurisdictions in which the 
Group operates. Where clients, customers or 
other third parties are harmed by the Group's 
conduct, this may also give rise to civil legal 
proceedings, including class actions. Other 
legal disputes may also arise between the 
Group and third parties relating to matters 
such as breaches or enforcement of legal 
rights or obligations arising under contracts, 
statutes or common law. Adverse findings 
in any such matters may result in the Group 
being liable to third parties or may result in the 
Group's rights not being enforced as intended.

Details of legal, competition and regulatory 
matters to which the Group is currently 
exposed are set out in Note 26. In addition 
to matters specifically described in Note 26, 
the Group is engaged in various other legal 
proceedings which arise in the ordinary 
course of business. The Group is also subject 
to requests for information, investigations 
and other reviews by regulators, governmental 
and other public bodies in connection with 
business activities in which the Group is, 
or has been, engaged.

The outcome of legal, competition and 
regulatory matters, both those to which the 
Group is currently exposed and any others 
which may arise in the future, is difficult to 
predict. In connection with such matters, 
the Group may incur significant expense, 
regardless of the ultimate outcome, and any 
such matters could expose the Group to 
any of the following outcomes: substantial 
monetary damages, settlements and/or fines; 
remediation of affected customers and clients; 
other penalties and injunctive relief; additional 
litigation; criminal prosecution; the loss of any 
existing agreed protection from prosecution; 
regulatory restrictions on the Group's business 
operations including the withdrawal of 
authorisations; increased regulatory 
compliance requirements or changes to laws 
or regulations; suspension of operations; 
public reprimands; loss of significant assets 
or business; a negative effect on the Group's 
reputation; loss of confidence by investors, 
counterparties, clients and/or customers; risk 
of credit rating agency downgrades; potential 
negative impact on the availability and/or cost 
of funding and liquidity; and/or dismissal or 
resignation of key individuals. In light of the 
uncertainties involved in legal, competition 
and regulatory matters, there can be no 
assurance that the outcome of a particular 
matter or matters will not have a material 
adverse effect on the Group's business, 
results of operations, financial condition 
and prospects.

RISK REVIEW

 Climate change risk management

Overview
The Group has a long-standing commitment to Environmental Risk Management (ERM) and its approach, aided by regulatory initiatives, has 
continued to evolve, incorporating climate change in recent years as the understanding of associated risks has grown. In 2018, a dedicated 
Sustainability team was created to consider how the Group approaches wider sustainability and ESG matters, working closely with the ERM function.

In 2019, the Group published an Energy & Climate Change Statement (home.barclays/statements/barclays-energy-and-climate-change-
statement) which articulates our focus on three areas: financing growth of renewables and businesses addressing environmental challenges; 
taking a responsible approach to financing energy sources with a greater carbon intensity; and reducing our own carbon footprint. 

It is supported by an internal standard containing guidelines for restricting or supporting financing activities in carbon-intensive energy sectors, 
as well as enhanced due diligence requirements for environmentally or socially sensitive sectors.

For more detail on how climate change risks arise and their impact on the Group, refer to material existing and emerging risks on page 131.

Organisation and structure
On behalf of the Board, the BRC reviews and approves the Group's approach to managing the financial and operational risks associated with 
climate change. 

Broadly, climate change matters are co-ordinated by the Sustainability team, including reputation risks linked to the Group's financial and societal 
impact. In 2019, reputation risk became the responsibility of the Board, where the most material issues facing the Group are escalated to and 
directly handled by the Board.

Board

Risk management – policy
In 2019, the Group published a ‘Climate Change Financial Risk and Operational Risk Policy'. This introduced climate change as an overarching risk 
impacting certain principal risks: credit risk, market risk, treasury & capital risk and operational risk. The policy is jointly owned by the relevant 
Principal Risk Leads with oversight by the BRC. 

Each relevant Principal Risk Lead has developed a methodology and implementation plan for quantifying climate change risk.

Risk Measurement approach

Credit risk A Credit Risk Materiality Matrix (Climate Lens) assesses the climate change risk of a counterparty to which 
the Group is exposed. The Climate Lens considers transition factors such as a counterparty's reliance on 
fossil fuels, sensitivity to policy changes and ability to diversify, as well as exposure to physical risks. Where 
an obligor is rated as Medium or High, the details are referred to the Environmental Risk Management team, 
who conduct enhanced due diligence.

Market risk Stress tests are used to assess and aggregate exposures arising from climate related risks. Stress test 
scenarios are applied to a range of assets, reflecting the impact of climate change across sectors, countries 
and regions.

Treasury and capital risk Stress tests are used to assess and aggregate exposures arising from climate related risks. They are 
measured as part of existing stress testing, ICAAP and capital planning.

Operational risk The risks associated with Climate Change are relevant to the following Operational Risk Categories/Themes, 
which are managed through the Operational Risk Framework: Premises Risk, Supplier Risk and Resilience. 
Climate Change has been included in the Strategic Risk Assessment to understand exposure on a forward 
looking basis across the five-year business planning cycle.

Credit risk management (audited)
The risk of loss to the Group from the failure of clients, customers or counterparties, including sovereigns, to fully honour their obligations to the 
Group, including the whole and timely payment of principal, interest, collateral and other receivables.

Overview
The credit risk that the Group faces arises from wholesale and retail loans and advances together with the counterparty credit risk arising from 
derivative contracts with clients; trading activities, including: debt securities, settlement balances with market counterparties, FVOCI assets and 
reverse repurchase loans.

Credit risk management objectives are to:

■■ maintain a framework of controls to oversee credit risk
■■ identify, assess and measure credit risk clearly and accurately across the Group and within each separate business, from the level of individual 

facilities up to the total portfolio
■■ control and plan credit risk taking in line with external stakeholder expectations and avoiding undesirable concentrations
■■ monitor credit risk and adherence to agreed controls.

Organisation, roles and responsibilities
The first line of defence has primary responsibility for managing credit risk within the risk appetite and limits set by the Risk function, supported by 
a defined set of policies, standards and controls. In the entities, business risk committees (attended by the first line) monitor and review the credit 
risk profile of each business unit where the most material issues are escalated to the Retail Credit Risk Management Committee, Wholesale Credit 
Risk Management Committee and Group Risk Committee.

Wholesale and retail portfolios are managed separately to reflect the differing nature of the assets; wholesale balances tend to be larger and are 
managed on an individual basis, while retail balances are greater in number but lesser in value and are, therefore, managed in aggregated segments.

The responsibilities of the credit risk management teams in the businesses, the sanctioning team and other shared services include: sanctioning 
new credit agreements (principally wholesale); setting strategies for approval of transactions (principally retail); setting risk appetite; monitoring 
risk against limits and other parameters; maintaining robust processes, data gathering, quality, storage and reporting methods for effective credit 
risk management; performing effective turnaround and workout scenarios for wholesale portfolios via dedicated restructuring and recoveries 
teams; maintaining robust collections and recovery processes/units for retail portfolios; and review and validation of credit risk measurement 
models. The credit risk management teams in each legal entity are accountable to the relevant Legal Entity CRO, who reports to the Group CRO.

For wholesale portfolios, credit risk managers are organised in sanctioning teams by geography, industry and/or product. In wholesale portfolios, 
credit risk approval is undertaken by experienced credit risk professionals operating within a clearly defined delegated authority framework, with 
only the most senior credit officers assigned the higher levels of delegated authority. The largest credit exposures, which are outside the Risk 
Sanctioning Unit or Risk Distribution Committee authority, require the support of a legal entity Senior Credit Officer. For exposures in excess of the 
legal entity Senior Credit Officer's authority, approval by Group Senior Credit Officer/Board Risk Committee is also required. The Group Credit Risk 
Committee, attended by legal entity Senior Credit Officers, provides a formal mechanism for the Group Senior Credit Officer to exercise the highest 
level of credit authority over the most material Group single name exposures. 

Credit risk mitigation
The Group employs a range of techniques and strategies to actively mitigate credit risks. These can broadly be divided into three types:

■■ netting and set-off
■■ collateral
■■ risk transfer.

Netting and set-off
Credit risk exposures can be reduced by applying netting and set-off. For derivative transactions, the Group's normal practice is, on a legal entity 
basis, to enter into standard master agreements with counterparties (e.g. ISDAs). These master agreements typically allow for netting of credit risk 
exposure to a counterparty resulting from derivative transactions against the obligations to the counterparty in the event of default, and so 
produce a lower net credit exposure. These agreements may also reduce settlement exposure (e.g. for foreign exchange transactions) by allowing 
payments on the same day in the same currency to be set-off against one another.

 Principal risk management
RISK REVIEW

Collateral
The Group has the ability to call on collateral in the event of default of the counterparty, comprising:

■■ home loans: a fixed charge over residential property in the form of houses, flats and other dwellings
■■ wholesale lending: a fixed charge over commercial property and other physical assets, in various forms
■■ other retail lending: includes charges over motor vehicles and other physical assets; second lien charges over residential property; and finance 

lease receivables
■■ derivatives: the Group also often seeks to enter into a margin agreement (e.g. Credit Support Annex) with counterparties with which the 

Group has master netting agreements in place. These annexes to master agreements provide a mechanism for further reducing credit risk, 
whereby collateral (margin) is posted on a regular basis (typically daily) to collateralise the mark to market exposure of a derivative portfolio 
measured on a net basis

■■ reverse repurchase agreements: collateral typically comprises highly liquid securities which have been legally transferred to the Group subject 
to an agreement to return them for a fixed price

■■ financial guarantees and similar off-balance sheet commitments: cash collateral may be held against these arrangements.

Risk transfer
A range of instruments including guarantees, credit insurance, credit derivatives and securitisation can be used to transfer credit risk from one 
counterparty to another. These mitigate credit risk in two main ways:

■■ if the risk is transferred to a counterparty which is more creditworthy than the original counterparty, then overall credit risk is reduced
■■ where recourse to the first counterparty remains, both counterparties must default before a loss materialises. This is less likely than the default 

of either counterparty individually so credit risk is reduced.

 Detailed policies are in place to appropriately recognise and record credit risk mitigation. For more information, refer to pages 175 to 177 of 
the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2019 (unaudited).

Governance and oversight of ECLs under IFRS 9
The Group's organisational structure and internal governance processes oversee the estimation of ECL across several areas, including: i) setting 
requirements in policy, including key assumptions and the application of key judgements; ii) the design and execution of models; and iii) review of 
ECL results.

i) Impairment policy requirements are set and reviewed regularly, at a minimum annually, to maintain adherence to accounting standards. Key 
judgements inherent in policy, including the estimated life of revolving credit facilities and the quantitative criteria for assessing the significant 
increase in credit risk (SICR), are separately supported by analytical study. In particular, the quantitative thresholds used for assessing SICR are 
subject to a number of internal validation criteria, particularly in retail portfolios where thresholds decrease as the origination PD of each facility 
increases. Key policy requirements are also typically aligned to the Group's credit risk management strategy and practices, for example, wholesale 
customers that are risk managed on an individual basis are assessed for ECL on an individual basis upon entering Stage 3; furthermore, key 
internal risk management indicators of high risk are used to set SICR policy, for example, retail customers identified as High Risk Management 
Accounts are automatically deemed to have met the SICR criteria.

ii) ECL is estimated in line with internal policy requirements using models which are validated by a qualified independent party to the model 
development area, the Independent Validation Unit (IVU), before first use and at a minimum annually thereafter. Each model is designated an 
owner who is responsible for:

■■ model maintenance: monitoring of model performance including backtesting by comparing predicted ECL versus flow into Stage 3 and 
coverage ratios; proposing material changes for independent IVU approval; and recalibrating model parameters on more timely data; and 

■■ proposing post-model adjustments (PMA) to address model weaknesses or to account for situations where known or expected risk factors 
and information have not been considered in the modelling process. Each PMA above an absolute and relative threshold is approved by the IVU 
for a set time period (usually a maximum of six months) together with a plan for remediation where related to a model deficiency. The most 
material PMAs are also approved by the CRO.

Models must also assess ECL across a range of future economic conditions. These economic scenarios are generated via an independent model 
and ultimately set by the Senior Scenario Review Committee. Economic scenarios are regenerated at a minimum annually, to align with the 
Group's medium-term planning exercise, but also if the external consensus of the UK or US economy materially worsen. Each model used in the 
estimation of ECL, including key inputs, are governed by a series of internal controls, which include the validation of completeness and accuracy of 
data in golden source systems, documented data transformations and documented lineage of data transfers between systems.

iii) The Group Impairment Committee, formed of members from both Finance and Risk and attended by both the Group Finance Director and the 
Group CRO, is responsible for overseeing impairment policy and practice across the Group and will approve impairment results. Reported results 
and key messages are communicated to the BAC, which has an oversight role and provides challenge of key assumptions, including the basis of 
the scenarios adopted. Impairment results are then factored into management decision-making, including but not limited to, business planning, 
risk appetite setting and portfolio management.

Market risk management (audited)
The risk of loss arising from potential adverse changes in the value of the Group's assets and liabilities from fluctuation in market variables 
including, but not limited to, interest rates, foreign exchange, equity prices, commodity prices, credit spreads, implied volatilities and 
asset correlations.

Overview
Market risk arises primarily as a result of client facilitation in wholesale markets, involving market-making activities, risk management solutions 
and execution of syndications. Upon execution of a trade with a client, the Group will look to hedge against the risk of the trade moving in an 
adverse direction. Mismatches between client transactions and hedges result in market risk due to changes in asset prices, volatility or correlations. 

Organisation, roles and responsibilities
Market risk in the businesses resides primarily in Barclays International and Treasury. These businesses have the mandate to assume market risk. 
The front office and Treasury trading desks are responsible for managing market risk on a day-to-day basis, where they are required to understand 
and adhere to all limits applicable to their businesses. The Market Risk team support the trading desks with the day-to-day limit management of 
market risk exposures through governance processes which are outlined in supporting market risk policies and standards.

Market risk oversight and challenge is provided by business committees and Group committees, including the Market Risk Committee.

The objectives of market risk management are to: 

■■ identify, understand and control market risk by robust measurement, limit setting, reporting and oversight
■■ facilitate business growth within a controlled and transparent risk management framework
■■ control market risk in the businesses according to the allocated appetite.

To meet the above objectives, a governance structure is in place to manage these risks consistent with the ERMF. 

The BRC recommends market risk appetite to the Board for their approval. The Market Risk Principal Risk Lead (PR Lead) is responsible for the 
Market Risk Control Framework and, under delegated authority from the Group CRO, agrees with the business CROs a limit framework within the 
context of the approved market risk appetite.

The Market Risk Committee approves and makes recommendations concerning the Group-wide market risk profile. This includes overseeing the 
operation of the Market Risk Framework and associated standards and policies; reviewing market or regulatory issues and limits and utilisation. 
The committee is chaired by the PR Lead and attendees include the business heads of market risk and business aligned market risk managers.

The head of each business is accountable for all market risks associated with its activities, while the head of the market risk team covering each 
business is responsible for implementing the risk control framework for market risk.

For more information on market risk management, refer to the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2019 (unaudited).

Management value at risk (VaR)
VaR is an estimate of the potential loss arising from unfavourable market movements if the current positions were to be held unchanged for one 
business day. For internal market risk management purposes, a historical simulation methodology with a two-year equally weighted historical 
period, at the 95% confidence level is used for all trading books and some banking books.

In some instances, historical data is not available for particular market risk factors for the entire look-back period, for example, complete historical 
data would not be available for an equity security following an initial public offering. In these cases, market risk managers will proxy the 
unavailable market risk factor data with available data for a related market risk factor.

Limits are applied at the total level as well as by risk factor type, which are then cascaded down to particular trading desks and businesses by the 
market risk management function.

See page 177 for a review of management VaR in 2019.

RISK REVIEW

 Principal risk management

Treasury and capital risk management
This comprises: 
Liquidity risk: the risk that the Group is unable to meet its contractual or contingent obligations or that it does not have the appropriate amount, 
tenor and composition of funding and liquidity to support its assets.

Capital risk: the risk that the Group has an insufficient level or composition of capital to support its normal business activities and to meet its 
regulatory capital requirements under normal operating environments or stressed conditions (both actual and as defined for internal planning or 
regulatory testing purposes). This also includes the risk from the Group's pension plans.

Interest rate risk in the banking book: the risk that the Group is exposed to capital or income volatility because of a mismatch between 
the interest rate exposures of its (non traded) assets and liabilities.

The Treasury function manages treasury and capital risk exposure on a day-to-day basis with the Group Treasury Committee acting as the 
principal management body. The Treasury and Capital Risk function is responsible for oversight and provides insight into key capital, liquidity, 
interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) and pension risk management activities.

Liquidity risk management (audited)
Overview
The efficient management of liquidity is essential to the Group in order to retain the confidence of the financial markets and maintain the 
sustainability of the business. The liquidity risk control framework is used to manage all liquidity risk exposures under both BAU and stressed 
conditions. The framework is designed to maintain liquidity resources that are sufficient in amount, quality and funding tenor profile to support 
the liquidity risk appetite as expressed by the Barclays PLC Board. The liquidity risk appetite is monitored against both internal and regulatory 
liquidity metrics.

Organisation, roles and responsibilities
Treasury has the primary responsibility for managing liquidity risk within the set risk appetite. Both Risk and Treasury contribute to the production 
of the Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP). The Treasury and Capital Risk function is responsible for the management and 
governance of the liquidity risk mandate, as defined by the Board. 

The liquidity risk control framework is designed to deliver the appropriate term and structure of funding, consistent with the liquidity risk appetite 
set by the Board. The control framework incorporates a range of ongoing business management tools to monitor, limit and stress test the Group's 
balance sheet, contingent liabilities and the recovery plan. Limit setting and transfer pricing are tools that are designed to control the level of 
liquidity risk taken and drive the appropriate mix of funds. Together, these tools reduce the likelihood that a liquidity stress event could lead to an 
inability to meet the Group's obligations as they fall due.

The Board approves the Group funding plan, internal stress tests, regulatory stress test results, and recovery plan. The Group Treasury Committee 
is responsible for monitoring and managing liquidity risk in line with the Group's funding management objectives, funding plan and risk 
framework. The Treasury and Capital Risk Committee monitors and reviews the liquidity risk profile and control environment, providing second 
line oversight of the management of liquidity risk. The BRC reviews the risk profile, and annually reviews risk appetite and the impact of stress 
scenarios on the Group funding plan/forecast in order to agree the Group's projected funding abilities.

Capital risk management (audited)
Overview
Capital risk is managed through ongoing monitoring and management of the capital position, regular stress testing and a robust capital 
governance framework. The objectives of the framework are to maintain adequate capital for the Group and legal entities to withstand the impact 
of the risks that may arise under normal and stressed conditions, and maintain adequate capital to cover current and forecast business needs and 
associated risks to provide a viable and sustainable business offering.

Organisation, roles and responsibilities
Treasury has the primary responsibility for managing and monitoring capital. The Treasury and Capital Risk function provides oversight of capital 
risk and is an independent risk function that reports to the Group CRO. Production of the Barclays PLC Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment 
Process (ICAAP) is the responsibility of the Treasury.

Capital risk management is underpinned by a control framework and policy. The capital management strategy, outlined in the Group and legal 
entity capital plans, is developed in alignment with the control framework and policy for capital risk, and is implemented consistently in order to 
deliver on the Group's objectives.

The Board approves the Group capital plan, internal stress tests and results of regulatory stress tests, and the Group recovery plan. The Group 
Treasury Committee is responsible for monitoring and managing capital risk in line with the Group's capital management objectives, capital plan 
and risk frameworks. The Treasury and Capital Risk Committee monitors and reviews the capital risk profile and control environment, providing 
second line oversight of the management of capital risk. The BRC reviews the risk profile, and annually reviews risk appetite and the impact of 
stress scenarios on the Group capital plan/forecast in order to agree the Group's projected capital adequacy. 

Local management assures compliance with an entity's minimum regulatory capital requirements by reporting to local Asset and Liability 
Committees (ALCOs) with oversight by the Group Treasury Committee, as required. In 2019, Barclays complied with all regulatory minimum 
capital requirements.

Pension risk 
The Group maintains a number of defined benefit pension schemes for past and current employees. The ability of schemes to meet pension 
payments is achieved with investments and contributions.

Pension risk arises because the market value of pension fund assets might decline; investment returns might reduce; or the estimated value of 
pension liabilities might increase. The Group monitors the pension risks arising from its defined benefit pension schemes and works with Trustees 
to address shortfalls. In these circumstances, the Group could be required or might choose to make extra contributions to the pension fund. 
The Group's main defined benefit scheme was closed to new entrants in 2012.

Interest rate risk in the banking book management (IRRBB)
Overview
Interest rate risk in the banking book is driven by customer deposit taking and lending activities, investments in the liquid asset portfolio and 
funding activities. As per the Group's policy to remain within the defined risk appetite, businesses and Treasury execute hedging strategies to 
mitigate the risks. However, the Group remains susceptible to interest rate risk and other non-traded market risks from key sources:

■■ interest rate and repricing risk: the risk that net interest income could be adversely impacted by a change in interest rates, differences in the 
timing of interest rate changes between assets and liabilities, and other constraints on interest rate changes as per product terms and 
conditions

■■ customer behavioural risk: the risk that net interest income could be adversely impacted by the discretion that customers and counterparties 
may have in respect of being able to vary their contractual obligations with Barclays. This risk is often referred to by industry regulators as 
‘embedded option risk'

■■ investment risks in the liquid asset portfolio: the risk that the fair value of assets held in the liquid asset portfolio and associated risk 
management portfolios could be adversely impacted by market volatility, creating volatility in capital directly.

Organisation, roles and responsibilities
The entity ALCOs, together with the Group Treasury Committee, are responsible for monitoring and managing IRRBB risk in line with the Group's 
management objectives and risk frameworks. The GRC and Treasury and Capital Risk Committee monitors and reviews the IRRBB risk profile and 
control environment, providing second line oversight of the management of IRRBB. The BRC reviews the interest rate risk profile, including annual 
review of the risk appetite and the impact of stress scenarios on the interest rate risk of the Group's banking books.

In addition, the Group's IRRBB policy sets out the processes and key controls required to identify all IRRBB risks arising from banking book 
operations, to monitor the risk exposures via a set of metrics with a frequency in line with the risk management horizon, and to manage these 
risks within agreed risk appetite and limits.

Operational risk management
The risk of loss to the Group from inadequate or failed processes or systems, human factors or due to external events (for example, fraud) where 
the root cause is not due to credit or market risks.

Overview
The management of operational risk has three key objectives:

■■ deliver an operational risk capability owned and used by business leaders to enable sound risk decisions over the long term
■■ provide the frameworks, policies and standards to enable management to meet their risk management responsibilities while the second line 

of defence provides robust, independent, and effective oversight and challenge
■■ deliver a consistent and aggregated measurement of operational risk that will provide clear and relevant insights, so that the right 

management actions can be taken to keep the operational risk profile consistent with the Group's strategy, the stated risk appetite and 
stakeholder needs.

The Group operates within a system of internal controls that enables business to be transacted and risk taken without exposing it to unacceptable 
potential losses or reputational damages.

https://home.barclays/investor-relations/reports-and-events/annual-reports/
<Page End><Page Start>
144 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2019 home.barclays/annualreport

Organisation, roles and responsibilities
The prime responsibility for the management of operational risk and the compliance with control requirements rests within the business and 
functional units where the risk arises. The operational risk profile and control environment is reviewed by management through business risk 
committees and control committees. Legal entities, businesses and functions are required to report their operational risks on both a regular and an 
event-driven basis. The reports include a profile of the material risks that may threaten the achievement of their objectives and the effectiveness of 
key controls, operational risk events and a review of scenarios.

The Group Head of Operational Risk is responsible for establishing, owning and maintaining an appropriate Group-wide Operational Risk 
Management Framework and for overseeing the portfolio of operational risk across the Group.

Operational Risk Management (ORM) acts in a second line of defence capacity, and is responsible for defining and overseeing the implementation 
of the framework and monitoring the Group's operational risk profile. ORM alerts management when risk levels exceed acceptable tolerance in 
order to drive timely decision-making and actions by the first line of defence. Operational risk issues escalated from these meetings are considered 
through the second line of defence review meetings. Depending on their nature, the outputs of these meetings are presented to the operational 
risk profile forum, the BRC or the BAC. In addition, specific reports are prepared by Operational Risk on a regular basis for the GRC and the BRC.

Operational risk categories
Operational risks are grouped into risk categories to support effective risk management, measurement and reporting. These comprise: Data 
Management & Information Risk; Financial Reporting Risk; Fraud Risk; Payments Process Risk; People Risk; Premises Risk; Physical Security Risk; 
Supplier Risk; Tax Risk; Technology Risk; Transaction Operations Risk and Execution Risk.

In addition to the above, operational risk encompasses risks associated with prudential regulation. This includes the risk of failing to: adhere to 
prudential regulatory requirements, provide regulatory submissions, or monitor and manage adherence to new prudential regulatory requirements.

Enterprise risk themes
Barclays also recognises that there are certain threats/risk drivers that are more thematic and have the potential to impact the Group's strategic 
objectives. These are enterprise risk themes which require an overarching and integrated risk management approach. The Group's enterprise risk 
themes include Cyber, Data, and Resilience.

 For definitions of the Group's operational risk categories and enterprise risk themes, refer to pages 198 to 201 of the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2019.

Model risk management
The risk of the potential adverse consequences from financial assessments or decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports.

Overview
The Group uses models to support a broad range of activities, including informing business decisions and strategies, measuring and limiting risk, 
valuing exposures, conducting stress testing, assessing capital adequacy, managing client assets, and meeting reporting requirements. 

Since models are imperfect and incomplete representations of reality, they may be subject to errors affecting the accuracy of their output. Model 
errors and misuse are the primary sources of model risk.

Organisation, roles and responsibilities
The Group has a dedicated Model Risk Management (MRM) function that consists of two main units: the Independent Validation Unit (IVU), 
responsible for model validation and approval, and Model Governance and Controls (MGC), covering model risk governance, controls and reporting, 
including ownership of model risk policy and the model inventory.

The model risk management framework consists of the model risk policy and standards. The policy prescribes Group-wide, end-to-end 
requirements for the identification, measurement and management of model risk, covering model documentation, development, implementation, 
monitoring, annual review, independent validation and approval, change and reporting processes. The policy is supported by global standards 
covering model inventory, documentation, validation, complexity and materiality, testing and monitoring, overlays, risk appetite, as well as vendor 
models and stress testing challenger models.

The function reports to the Group CRO and operates a global framework. Implementation of best practice standards is a central objective of 
the Group.

The key model risk management activities include: 

■■ correctly identifying models across all relevant areas of the Group, and recording models in the Group Models Database (GMD), the Group-
wide model inventory

■■ enforcing that every model has a model owner who is accountable for the model. The model owner must sign off models prior to submission 
to IVU for validation and maintain that the model presented to IVU is and remains fit for purpose

■■ overseeing that every model is subject to validation and approval by IVU, prior to being implemented and on a continual basis
■■ defining model risk appetite in terms of risk tolerance, and qualitative metrics which are used to track and report model risk.

Conduct risk management
The risk of detriment to customers, clients, market integrity, effective competition or Barclays from the inappropriate supply of financial services, 
including instances of wilful or negligent misconduct.

Overview
The Group defines, manages and mitigates conduct risk with the objective of providing good customer and client outcomes, protecting market 
integrity and promoting effective competition.

Product Life cycle, Culture and Strategy and Financial Crime are the risk categories under the Group definition of conduct risk. 

Organisation, roles and responsibilities
The governance of conduct risk within the Group is fulfilled through management committees and forums operated by the first and second lines 
of defence with clear escalation and reporting lines to the Board.

The Group Risk Committee is the most senior executive body responsible for reviewing and monitoring the effectiveness of the Group's 
management of conduct risk.

The Conduct Risk Management Framework (CRMF) outlines how the Group manages and measures its conduct risk profile. 

Senior managers have accountability for managing conduct risk in their areas of responsibility. This is expressed in their Statements of 
Responsibilities. The primary responsibility for managing conduct risk sits with the business where the risk arises. The first line business control 
committees provide oversight of controls relating to conduct risk. 

The Group Chief Compliance Officer is responsible for owning and maintaining an appropriate Group-wide CRMF. This includes defining and 
owning the relevant conduct risk policies and oversight of the implementation of controls to manage and escalate the risk.

The Group and the Barclays UK Risk Committees are the primary second line governance committees for oversight of conduct risk profile and 
implementation of the CRMF. The responsibilities of these risk committees in relation to the trading entities includes the identification and 
discussion of any emerging conduct risks exposures which have been identified.

Reputation risk management
The risk that an action, transaction, investment, event, decision, or business relationship will reduce trust in the Group's integrity 
and/or competence.

Overview
A reduction of trust in the Group's integrity and competence may reduce the attractiveness of the Group to stakeholders and could lead to 
negative publicity, loss of revenue, regulatory or legislative action, loss of existing and potential client business, reduced workforce morale and 
difficulties in recruiting talent. Ultimately, it may destroy shareholder value.

Organisation, roles and responsibilities
The GRC is the most senior executive body responsible for reviewing and monitoring the effectiveness of the Group's management of reputation risk.

The Group Chief Compliance Officer is accountable for developing a Reputation Risk Management Framework (RRMF), and the Head of Corporate 
Relations is responsible for developing a reputation risk policy and associated standards, including tolerances against which data is monitored, 
reported on and escalated, as required. The RRMF sets out what is required to manage reputation risk across the Group.

The primary responsibility for identifying and managing reputation risk and adherence to the control requirements sits with the business and 
support functions where the risk arises.

Barclays Bank Group and Barclays Bank UK Group are required to operate within established reputation risk appetite, and their component 
businesses prepare reports for their respective Risk and Board Risk Committees highlighting their most significant current and potential reputation 
risks and issues and how they are being managed. These reports are a key internal source of information for the quarterly reputation risk reports 
which are prepared for the GRC and the Board.

Legal risk management
The risk of loss or imposition of penalties, damages or fines from the failure of the Group to meet its legal obligations including regulatory or 
contractual requirements.

Overview 
The Group has no tolerance for wilful breaches of laws, regulations or other legal obligations. However, the multitude of laws and regulations 
across the globe are highly dynamic and their application to particular circumstances is often unclear; this results in a level of inherent legal risk, 
for which the Group has limited tolerance.

Organisation, roles and responsibilities 
The Group's businesses and functions have primary responsibility for identifying, managing and escalating legal risk in their area as well as 
responsibility for adherence to minimum control requirements.

The Legal Function organisation and coverage model aligns expertise to businesses, functions, products, activities and geographic locations so 
that the Group receives legal support from appropriate legal professionals. The senior management of the Legal Function oversees, monitors and 
challenges legal risk across the Group. The Legal Function does not sit in any of the three lines of defence but supports them all.

The Group General Counsel is responsible for maintaining an appropriate Group-wide legal risk management framework. This includes defining 
the relevant legal risk policies and oversight of the implementation of controls to manage and escalate legal risk. 

The legal risk profile and control environment is reviewed by management through business risk committees and control committees. The Group 
Risk Committee is the most senior executive body responsible for reviewing and monitoring the effectiveness of risk management across the 
Group. Escalation paths from this committee exist to the Barclays PLC Board Risk Committee.

RISK REVIEW: CREDIT RISK

 Risk performance

Summary of performance 
in the period
Credit impairment charges increased to 
£1,912m (2018: £1,468m). The 2019 charge 
includes the impact of macroeconomic 
scenario updates and an overall reduction in 
unsecured gross exposures. Prior year 
comparatives included the impact of 
favourable macroeconomic scenario updates 
and a £150m charge regarding the anticipated 
economic uncertainty in the UK. The Group 
loan loss rate was 55bps (2018: 44bps).

Refer to the credit risk management section 
on pages 139 to 140 for details of governance, 
policies and procedures.

Maximum exposure and 
effects of netting, collateral 
and risk transfer
Basis of preparation
The following tables present a reconciliation 
between the maximum exposure and its net 
exposure to credit risk, reflecting the financial 
effects of risk mitigation reducing 
the exposure. 

For financial assets recognised on the balance 
sheet, maximum exposure to credit risk 
represents the balance sheet carrying value 
after allowance for impairment. For off-balance 
sheet guarantees, the maximum exposure is 
the maximum amount that the Group would 
have to pay if the guarantees were to be called 
upon. For loan commitments and other credit 
related commitments that are irrevocable 
over the life of the respective facilities, 
the maximum exposure is the full amount 
of the committed facilities.

This and subsequent analyses of credit risk 
exclude other financial assets not subject 
to credit risk, mainly equity securities.

The Group mitigates the credit risk to which 
it is exposed through netting and set-off, 
collateral and risk transfer. Further detail on 
the Group's policies to each of these forms 
of credit enhancement is presented on pages 
175 to 177 of the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 
Report 2019 (unaudited).

Overview
As at 31 December 2019, the Group's net 
exposure to credit risk, after taking into 
account credit risk mitigation, decreased 
0.9% to £800.3bn. Overall, the extent to 
which the Group holds mitigation against 
its total exposure remained unchanged at 
43% (2018: 43%).

Of the unmitigated on-balance sheet 
exposure, a significant portion relates to 
cash held at central banks, cash collateral 
and settlement balances, and debt securities 
issued by governments all of which are 
considered to be lower risk. The decrease in 
the Group's net exposure to credit risk is due 
to decreases in cash held at central banks and 
trading portfolio assets, offset by increases in 
cash collateral and settlement balances, 
financial assets at fair value through other 
comprehensive income and off-balance sheet 
loan commitments. Trading portfolio liability 
positions, which to a significant extent 
economically hedge trading portfolio assets 
but which are not held specifically for risk 
management purposes, are excluded from the 
analysis. The credit quality of counterparties 
to derivatives, financial investments and 
wholesale loan assets are predominantly 
investment grade. Further analysis on the 
credit quality of assets is presented on pages 
165 to 168.

Collateral obtained
Where collateral has been obtained in 
the event of default, the Group does not, 
ordinarily, use such assets for its own 
operations and they are usually sold on 
a timely basis. The carrying value of assets 
held by the Group as at 31 December 2019, 
as a result of the enforcement of collateral, 
was £6m (2018: £6m). 

Credit risk
All disclosures in this section (pages 
148 to 175) are unaudited unless 
otherwise stated.

Overview
Credit risk represents a significant risk 
to the Group and mainly arises from 
exposure to wholesale and retail loans 
and advances together with the 
counterparty credit risk arising from 
derivative contracts entered into with 
clients.

Credit risk disclosures include many 
of the recommendations of the 
Taskforce on Disclosures about 
Expected Credit Losses (DECL) and it 
is expected that relevant disclosures 
will continue to be developed in future 
periods.

Further detail can be found in the 
Financial statements section in  
Note 7 Credit impairment charges. 
Descriptions of terminology can 
be found in the glossary, available 
at home.barclays/annualreport

Key metrics
Reduction in impairment 
allowances of

£411m
Impairment allowances on loans 
and advances at amortised cost, 
including off-balance sheet elements 
of the allowance, decreased by £411m 
to £6,630m (2018: £7,041m). The 
decrease is driven by Barclays UK 
£300m, Barclays International £92m 
and Head Office £19m. Refer to the 
Expected Credit Losses section on 
page 151 for further details.

Expected Credit Losses
Loans and advances at amortised cost by stage
The table below presents an analysis of loans and advances at amortised cost by gross exposure, impairment allowance, coverage ratio and 
impairment charge by stage allocation and business segment as at 31 December 2019. Also included are off-balance sheet loan commitments 
and financial guarantee contracts by gross exposure and impairment allowance and coverage ratio by stage allocation as at 31 December 2019.

Impairment allowance under IFRS 9 considers both the drawn and the undrawn counterparty exposure. For retail portfolios, the total impairment 
allowance is allocated to the drawn exposure to the extent that the allowance does not exceed the exposure as ECL is not reported separately. 
Any excess is reported on the liability side of the balance sheet as a provision. For wholesale portfolios, the impairment allowance on the undrawn 
exposure is reported on the liability side of the balance sheet as a provision.

Movement in gross exposures and impairment allowance including provisions  
for loan commitments and financial guarantees
The following tables present a reconciliation of the opening to the closing balance of the exposure and impairment allowance. An explanation 
of the terms: 12-month ECL, lifetime ECL and credit-impaired is included on page 259. The disclosure has been enhanced in 2019 to provide 
further granularity by product. Transfers between stages in the tables have been reflected as if they had taken place at the beginning of the year. 
The movements are measured over a 12-month period.

Notes
a Changes to models used for calculation include a £101m movement in Credit cards, unsecured loans and other retail lending and a £28m movement in Wholesale loans. These 

reflect methodology changes made during the year. Barclays continually review the output of models to determine accuracy of the ECL calculation including review of model 
monitoring, external benchmarking and experience of model operation over an extended period of time. This ensures that the models used continue to reflect the risks inherent 
across the businesses.

b The £787m movement of gross loans and advances disposed of across Home loans relates to the sale of a portfolio of mortgages from the Italian loan book. The £777m disposal 
reported within Credit cards, unsecured loans and other retail lending portfolio relates to debt sales undertaken during the year. Finally, disposals of £2,285m within Wholesale loans 
relate to the sale of debt securities as part of the Group's Treasury operations.

c In 2019, gross write-offs amounted to £1,883m (2018: £1,891m) and post write-off recoveries amounted to £124m (2018: £195m). Net write-offs represent gross write-offs less post 
write-off recoveries and amounted to £1,759m (2018: £1,696m).

d Other financial assets subject to impairment not included in the table above include cash collateral and settlement balances, financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive 
income and other assets. These have a total gross exposure of £149.3bn (December 2018: £129.9bn) and impairment allowance of £24m (December 2018: £12m). This comprises 
£12m ECL (December 2018: £10m) on £148.5bn Stage 1 assets (December 2018: £129.3bn), £2m (December 2018: £2m) on £0.8bn Stage 2 fair value through other comprehensive 
income assets, cash collateral and settlement assets (December 2018: £0.6bn) and £10m (December 2018: £nil) on £10m Stage 3 other assets (December 2018: £nil).

a Other financial assets subject to impairment not included in the table above include cash collateral and settlement balances, financial assets at fair value through other 

comprehensive income and other assets. These have a total gross exposure of £129.9bn (1 January 2018: £128.1bn) and impairment allowance of £12m (1 January 2018: £9m). 
This comprises £10m ECL on £129.3bn Stage 1 assets and £2m on £0.6bn Stage 2 fair value through other comprehensive income assets.

b Impairment release of £125m on loan commitments and financial guarantees represents reduction in impairment allowance of £149m partially offset by exchange and other 
adjustments of £24m.

Note
a Where balances satisfy more than one of the above three criteria for determining a significant increase in credit risk, the corresponding gross exposure and ECL has been assigned 

in order of categories presented.

Stage 2 exposures are predominantly identified using quantitative tests where the lifetime PD has deteriorated more than a predetermined 
amount since origination. This is augmented by inclusion of accounts meeting the designated high risk criteria (including watchlist) for the 
portfolio under the qualitative test. Qualitative tests predominantly include £9.3bn in Barclays UK of which £7.4bn relates to UK Home Finance, 
£1.1bn relates to Business Banking and £0.4bn relates to Barclaycard UK. A further £3.4bn relates to Barclays International of which £1.7bn relates 
to Corporate and Investment Bank, £0.9bn relates to Barclaycard International and £0.7bn relates to Private Bank.

A small number of other accounts (2% of impairment allowances and 4% of gross exposure) are included in Stage 2. These accounts are not 
otherwise identified by the quantitative or qualitative tests but are more than 30 days past due. The percentage triggered by these backstop 
criteria is a measure of the effectiveness of the Stage 2 criteria in identifying deterioration prior to delinquency. These balances include items in the 
Corporate and Investment Bank for reasons such as outstanding interest and fees rather than principal balances.

For further detail on the three criteria for determining a significant increase in credit risk required for Stage 2 classification, refer to Note 7 
on page 259.

RISK REVIEW: CREDIT RISK

 Risk performance

Home loans: the low average LTV nature of the UK Home Loans portfolio means that modelled ECL estimates are low in all but the most severe 
economic scenarios. An adjustment is held to maintain an appropriate level of ECL.

Credit cards, unsecured loans and other retail lending: management adjustments primarily relate to UK Cards where model adjustments have 
been made to maintain adequacy of Loss Given Default and Probability of Default estimates.

Following recent portfolio analysis and industry benchmarking, releases were applied to the UK cards and US cards portfolios to account for 
changes in the modelled lifetime of credit cards in Stage 2. These adjustments will be removed once updates to the model have been 
incorporated.

A £100m ECL adjustment is held in UK Cards for the anticipated impact of economic uncertainty in the UK, first taken in December 2018 
and retained as at 2019 year end.

Wholesale loans: Adjustments include a release in Investment Bank to reduce inappropriate ECL sensitivity to a macroeconomic variable 
and model adjustments in Corporate and Investment Bank related to Probability of Default at origination and Loss Given Default floors.

A £50m ECL adjustment is held in Corporate and Investment Bank for the anticipated impact of economic uncertainty in the UK, first taken in 
December 2018 and retained as at 2019 year end.

Measurement uncertainty and sensitivity analysis
The measurement of ECL involves complexity and judgement, including estimation of probabilities of default (PD), loss given default (LGD), 
a range of unbiased future economic scenarios, estimation of expected lives, estimation of exposures at default (EAD) and assessing significant 
increases in credit risk.

The Group uses a five-scenario model to calculate ECL. An external consensus forecast is assembled from key sources, including HM Treasury 
(short- and medium-term forecasts), Bloomberg (based on median of economic forecasts) and the Urban Land Institute (for US House Prices), 
which forms the Baseline scenario. In addition, two adverse scenarios (Downside 1 and Downside 2) and two favourable scenarios (Upside 1 
and Upside 2) are derived, with associated probability weightings. The adverse scenarios are calibrated to a similar severity to internal stress tests, 
whilst also considering IFRS 9 specific sensitivities and non-linearity. Downside 2 is benchmarked to the Bank of England's annual cyclical 
scenarios and to the most severe scenario from Moody's inventory, but is not designed to be the same. The favourable scenarios are calibrated 
to be symmetric to the adverse scenarios, subject to a ceiling calibrated to relevant recent favourable benchmark scenarios. All scenarios are 
regenerated at a minimum annually. The scenarios include eight economic variables (GDP, unemployment, House Price Index (HPI) and base rates 
in both the UK and US markets), and expanded variables using statistical models based on historical correlations. The upside and downside shocks 
are designed to evolve over a five-year stress horizon, with all five scenarios converging to a steady state after approximately eight years.

Scenario weights (audited)
The methodology for estimating probability weights for each of the scenarios involves a comparison of the distribution of key historical UK and US 
macroeconomic variables against the forecast paths of the five scenarios. The methodology works such that the Baseline (reflecting current 
consensus outlook) has the highest weight and the weights of adverse and favourable scenarios depend on the deviation from the Baseline; 
the further from the Baseline, the smaller the weight. This is reflected in the table below where the probability weights of the scenarios as of 
31 December 2019 are shown. A single set of five scenarios is used across all portfolios and all five weights are normalised to equate to 100%. 
The same scenarios and weights that are used in the estimation of expected credit losses are also used for Barclays internal planning purposes. 
The impacts across the portfolios are different because of the sensitivities of each of the portfolios to specific macroeconomic variables, for 
example, mortgages are highly sensitive to house prices and base rates, credit cards and unsecured consumer loans are highly sensitive 
to unemployment.

The tables below show the macroeconomic variables for each scenario and their respective scenario weights. Macroeconomic variables are 
presented using the most relevant basis for each variable. five-year average tables and movement over time graphs provide additional transparency.

The weights of Upside 2 and Downside 2 have increased slightly reflecting the small decrease in dispersion in the scenarios. The impact on ECL 
is immaterial.

c Lowest yearly average in Upside scenarios; five-year average in Baseline; highest yearly average in Downside scenarios.
d Cumulative growth (trough-to-peak) in Upside scenarios; five-year average in Baseline; cumulative fall (peak-to-trough) in Downside scenarios.

Over the year, the macroeconomic baseline variables have worsened in the US, in part due to the trade dispute with China. Baseline expectations 
for the US federal funds rate have also moved lower from 2.7% to 1.7% averaged over the first five years. Macroeconomic baseline variables in the 
UK have remained fairly flat with a small decrease in bank rates driven by market expectations of lower interest rates in the next few years. The 
other scenarios are generally unchanged from 2018, with the exception of UK HPI in the Downside 1 scenario where the cumulative fall in house 
prices now represents a more severe fall of 8.2% versus 0.5% in 2018.

ECL under 100% weighted scenarios for modelled portfolios (audited)
The table below shows the ECL assuming scenarios have been 100% weighted. Model exposures are allocated to a stage based on the individual 
scenario rather than through a probability-weighted approach as required for Barclays reported impairment allowances. As a result, it is not 
possible to back solve to the final reported weighted ECL from the individual scenarios as a balance may be assigned to a different stage 
dependent on the scenario. Model exposure uses Exposure at Default (EAD) values and is not directly comparable to gross exposure used in prior 
disclosures. For Credit cards, unsecured loans and other retail lending, an average EAD measure is used (12 month or lifetime depending on stage 
allocation in each scenario). Therefore, the model exposure movement into Stage 2 is higher than the corresponding Stage 1 reduction.

All ECL using a model is included, with the exception of Treasury assets (£9m of ECL), providing additional coverage as compared to the 2018 
year-end disclosure. Non-modelled exposures and management adjustments are excluded. Management adjustments can be found on page 157. 
The prior year comparative includes key principal portfolios amounting to circa 80% of total impairment allowance.

Model exposures allocated to Stage 3 do not change in any of the scenarios as the transition criteria relies only on observable evidence of default 
as at 31 December 2019 and not on macroeconomic scenarios.

The Downside 2 scenario represents a severe global recession with substantial falls in both UK and US GDP. Unemployment in both markets rises 
towards 9% and there are substantial falls in asset prices including housing.

Under the Downside 2 scenario, model exposure moves between stages as the economic environment weakens. This can be seen in the 
movement of £29bn of model exposure into Stage 2 between the Weighted and Downside 2 scenario. ECL increases in Stage 2 predominantly 
due to unsecured portfolios as economic conditions deteriorate.

The total weighted ECL represents a 3% uplift from the Baseline ECL, largely driven by credit card losses which have more linear loss profiles than 
UK home loans and wholesale loan positions.

Home loans: total weighted ECL of £315m represents a 2% increase over the Baseline ECL (£307m), and coverage ratios remain steady across the 
Upside scenarios, Baseline and Downside 1 scenario. However, total ECL increases in the Downside 2 scenario to £506m, driven by a significant fall 
in UK HPI (32.4%), reflecting the non-linearity of the UK portfolio. 

Credit cards, unsecured loans and other retail lending: total weighted ECL of £4,547m represents a 2% increase over the Baseline ECL (£4,461m) 
reflecting the range of economic scenarios used, mainly impacted by unemployment. Total ECL increases to £7,105m under the Downside 2 
scenario, mainly driven by Stage 2, where coverage rates increase to 21.8% from a weighted scenario approach of 13.8% and circa £6bn increase 
in model exposure that meets the Significant Increase in Credit Risk criteria and transitions from Stage 1 to Stage 2.

Wholesale loans: total weighted ECL of £741m represents a 9% increase over the Baseline ECL (£679m) reflecting the range of economic 
scenarios used, with exposures in the Investment Bank particularly sensitive to the Downside 2 scenario.

Note
a Material corporate loan defaults are individually assessed across different recovery strategies which are impacted by the macroeconomic variables. As a result, only the Baseline 

scenario is shown together with the weighted estimate which reflects alternative recovery paths.

Staging sensitivity (audited)
An increase of 1% (£3,454m) of total gross exposure into Stage 2 (from Stage 1), would result in an increase in ECL impairment allowance 
of £207m based on applying the difference in Stage 2 and Stage 1 average impairment coverage ratios to the movement in gross exposure 
(refer to Loans and advances at amortised cost by product on page 153).

Analysis of the concentration of credit risk
A concentration of credit risk exists when a number of counterparties are located in a common geographical region or are engaged in similar 
activities and have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by 
changes in economic or other conditions. The Group implements limits on concentrations in order to mitigate the risk. The analyses of credit risk 
concentrations presented below are based on the location of the counterparty or customer or the industry in which they are engaged. Further 
detail on the Group policies with regard to managing concentration risk is presented on page 159 of Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2019 (unaudited).

Geographic concentrations
As at 31 December 2019, the geographic concentration of the Group's assets remained broadly consistent with 2018. Exposure is concentrated 
in the UK 40% (2018: 41%), in the Americas 34% (2018: 34%) and Europe 20% (2018: 21%).

The approach to management and representation of credit quality

Asset credit quality 
The credit quality distribution is based on the IFRS 9 12-month probability of default (PD) at the reporting date to ensure comparability with other 
ECL disclosures on pages 151 to 157.

The following internal measures are used to determine credit quality for loans:

Default Grade
Retail and Wholesale lending

Probability of default
Credit Quality 

Description
1-3 0.0 to <0.05% Strong
4-5 0.05 to <0.15%
6-8 0.15 to <0.30%
9-11 0.30 to <0.60%
12-14 0.60 to <2.15% Satisfactory
15-19 2.15 to <10%
19 10 to <11.35%
20-21 11.35 to <100% Higher Risk
22 100%  Credit Impaired

For retail clients, a range of analytical tools is used to derive the probability of default of clients at inception and on an ongoing basis.

For loans that are not past due, these descriptions can be summarised as follows:

Strong: there is a very high likelihood of the asset being recovered in full.

Satisfactory: while there is a high likelihood that the asset will be recovered and therefore, of no cause for concern to the Group, the asset may 
not be collateralised, or may relate to unsecured retail facilities. At the lower end of this grade there are customers that are being more carefully 
monitored, for example, corporate customers which are indicating some evidence of deterioration, mortgages with a high loan to value, and 
unsecured retail loans operating outside normal product guidelines.

Higher risk: there is concern over the obligor's ability to make payments when due. However, these have not yet converted to actual delinquency. 
There may also be doubts over the value of collateral or security provided. However, the borrower or counterparty is continuing to make payments 
when due and is expected to settle all outstanding amounts of principal and interest.

Loans that are past due are monitored closely, with impairment allowances raised as appropriate and in line with the Group's impairment policies. 

Debt securities
For assets held at fair value, the carrying value on the balance sheet will include, among other things, the credit risk of the issuer. Most listed and 
some unlisted securities are rated by external rating agencies. The Group mainly uses external credit ratings provided by Standard & Poor's, Fitch 
or Moody's. Where such ratings are not available or are not current, the Group will use its own internal ratings for the securities.

Balance sheet credit quality
The following tables present the credit quality of the Group's assets exposed to credit risk.

Overview
As at 31 December 2019, the ratio of the Group's on-balance sheet assets classified as strong (0.0 to <0.60%) remained stable at 86% (2018: 86%) 
of total assets exposed to credit risk.

Further analysis of debt securities by issuer and issuer type and netting and collateral arrangements on derivative financial instruments 
is presented on pages 174 and 175 respectively.

Credit exposures by internal PD grade
The below tables represent credit risk profile by PD grade for loans and advances at amortised cost, contingent liabilities and loan commitments.

Stage 1 higher risk assets, presented gross of associated collateral held, are of weaker credit quality but have not significantly deteriorated 
since origination. Examples would include leveraged corporate loans or non-prime credit cards.

IFRS 9 Stage 1 and Stage 2 classification is not dependent solely on the absolute probability of default but on elements that determine a 
Significant Increase in Credit Risk (see Note 7 on page 259), including relative movement in probability of default since initial recognition. 
There is therefore no direct relationship between credit quality and IFRS 9 stage classification.

RISK REVIEW: CREDIT RISK

Home loans principal portfolios – new lending

As at 31 December
Barclays UK

2019 2018
New bookings (£m) 25,530 23,473
New home loan proportion above >90% LTV (%) 4.2 1.8
Average LTV on new home loans: balance weighted (%) 67.9 65.4
Average LTV on new home loans: valuation weighted (%) 60.0 57.4

The value of new bookings increased across both the owner-occupied and BTL portfolios, 9.2% and 6.5% respectively. High LTV lending booked 
in 2019 increased, driven by market conditions.

Head Office: Italian home loans and advances at amortised cost reduced to £6.0bn (2018: £7.9bn) and continue to run-off since new bookings 
ceased in 2016. The portfolio is secured on residential property with an average balance weighted mark to market LTV of 64.4% (2018: 61.8%). 
90-day arrears increased to 1.8% (2018: 1.4%), a function of the balance reduction associated with the sale of £787m assets in Q3 2019, gross 
charge-off rates remained stable at 0.8% (2018: 0.8%).

Credit cards, unsecured loans and other retail lending
The principal portfolios listed below accounted for 87% (2018: 86%) of the Group's total credit cards, unsecured loans and other retail lending.

UK cards: following the introduction of payment reminders both 30- and 90-day arrears rates reduced by 0.1%. The annualised gross write-off 
rate reduced to 1.6% (2018: 1.9%), reflecting lower levels of delinquency and contractual charge-offs through 2019, albeit with increased debt 
sales from the recovery book.

UK personal loans: 30- and 90-day arrears rates reduced by 0.2% and 0.1% respectively, reflecting a continued improvement in lending quality 
over the past two years, coupled with improvements in collections effectiveness. Write-off rates increased significantly reflecting higher 
charge-offs in 2018.

US cards: 30- and 90-day arrears rates remained stable. The annualised gross and net write-off rates increased to 4.5% (2018: 3.6%) and 4.4% 
(2018: 3.4%) respectively primarily driven by an increase in charge-offs in 2018. The percentage of write-offs to charge-offs was stable year on 
year.

Barclays Partner Finance: improvement in 30- and 90-day arrears was driven by better arrears management and improved customer selection. 
Annualised write-off rates remained flat.

Germany consumer lending: improvement in 30- and 90-day arrears was driven by better collections performance across all products. 
The annualised write-off rates improved in line with expectations.

Note
a 2018 metrics have been restated to exclude up to date, paying customers classified as Stage 1.

UK home loans: Forbearance balances reduced to £137m (2018: £182m) due to a reduction in volumes of entries into collections and new 
forbearance plans.

UK cards: Forbearance balances decreased in line with the reduction in delinquent balances.

UK personal loans: Forbearance balances decreased in line with the reduction in delinquent balances.

US cards: Forbearance balances increased to £183m (2018: £177m) in line with book size but as a percentage of total balance remained low 
(<1%). Lower coverage was driven by favourable macroeconomic conditions.

Barclays Partner Finance: The reduction in forbearance balances was mainly driven by the rundown of the motor business over the course of 
2019.

Germany consumer lending: Improved performance and higher quality bookings led to fewer accounts moving into forbearance.

Italian home loans: Forbearance balances reduced to £130m (2018: £165m), due to an asset sale in Q3 2019.

Derivative asset exposures would be £209bn (2018: £203bn) lower than reported under IFRS if netting were permitted for assets and liabilities 
with the same counterparty or for which the Group holds cash collateral. Similarly, derivative liabilities would be £212bn (2018: £202bn) lower 
reflecting counterparty netting and collateral placed. In addition, non-cash collateral of £6bn (2018: £6bn) was held in respect of derivative assets. 
The Group received collateral from clients in support of over the counter derivative transactions. These transactions are generally undertaken 
under International Swaps and Derivative Association (ISDA) agreements governed by either UK or New York law.

Outlines key measures used to summarise the market risk profile 
of the bank such as value at risk (VaR).

■■ Market risk overview and summary of performance 176

The Group discloses details on management measures of market 
risk. Total management VaR includes all trading positions and is 
presented on a diversified basis by risk factor. 

This section also outlines the macroeconomic conditions 
modelled as part of the Group's risk management framework.

All disclosures in this section (pages 
176 to 177) are unaudited unless 
otherwise stated.

Overview
This section contains key statistics 
describing the market risk profile 
of the Group. The market risk 
management section on page 177 
provides a description of management 
VaR.

Measures of market risk in the 
Group and accounting measures
Traded market risk measures such as VaR 
and balance sheet exposure measures have 
fundamental differences:

■■ balance sheet measures show accruals-
based balances or marked to market values 
as at the reporting date

■■ VaR measures also take account of current 
marked to market values, but in addition 
hedging effects between positions are 
considered

■■ market risk measures are expressed in 
terms of changes in value or volatilities 
as opposed to static values.

For these reasons, it is not possible to present 
direct reconciliations of traded market risk 
and accounting measures.

Summary of performance 
in the period
Overall, the Group has maintained a steady 
market risk profile. Average management VaR 
increased by 10% to £23m in 2019 (2018: 
£21m) and remained relatively stable during 
the period. The increase in average 
management VaR in 2019 was driven by a 
small increase in equity risk and credit risk, 
partially offset by a slight decrease in interest 
rate risk compared to 2018.

Traded market risk review
Review of management measures
The following disclosures provide details on 
management measures of market risk. Refer 
to the market risk management section on 
pages 179 to 186 of the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 
Report 2019 (unaudited) for more detail on 
management measures and the differences 
when compared to regulatory measures.

The table below shows the total management 
VaR on a diversified basis by risk factor. 
Total management VaR includes all trading 
positions in CIB and Treasury and it is 
calculated with a one-day holding period.

Limits are applied against each risk factor VaR 
as well as total management VaR, which are 
then cascaded further by risk managers to 
each business.

Notes

b Diversification effects recognise that forecast losses from different assets or businesses are unlikely to occur concurrently, hence the expected aggregate loss is lower than the sum 

of the expected losses from each area. Historical correlations between losses are taken into account in making these assessments. The high and low VaR figures reported for each 
category did not necessarily occur on the same day as the high and low VaR reported as a whole. Consequently, a diversification effect balance for the high and low VaR figures 
would not be meaningful and is therefore omitted from the above table.

Business scenario stresses
As part of the Group's risk management framework, on a regular basis, the performance of the trading business in hypothetical scenarios 
characterised by severe macroeconomic conditions is modelled. Up to seven global scenarios are modelled on a regular basis, for example,  
a sharp deterioration in liquidity, a slowdown in the global economy, global recession and a sharp increase in economic growth.

In 2019, the scenario analyses showed that the largest market risk related impacts would be due to a severe deterioration in financial liquidity 
and a global recession.

RISK REVIEW: TREASURY AND CAPITAL RISK

 Risk performance

Treasury and Capital risk: summary of contents Page
Liquidity risk performance
The risk that the firm is unable to meet its contractual 
or contingent obligations or that it does not have the 
appropriate amount, tenor and composition of funding 
and liquidity to support its assets. 

This section provides an overview of the Group's 
liquidity risk.

In addition to monitoring and managing key metrics 
related to the financial strength of the Group, Barclays 
solicits independent credit ratings.

These ratings assess the creditworthiness of the Group, 
its subsidiaries and branches and are based on reviews 
of a broad range of business and financial attributes 
including risk management processes and procedures, 
capital strength, earnings, funding, asset quality, liquidity, 
accounting and governance.

Capital risk performance
Capital risk is the risk that the firm has an insufficient level 
or composition of capital to support its normal business 
activities and to meet its regulatory capital requirements 
under normal operating environments or stressed 
conditions (both actual and as defined for internal 
planning or regulatory testing purposes). This also 
includes the risk from the firm's pension plans.

RISK REVIEW: TREASURY AND CAPITAL RISK

 Risk performance

Summary of performance
The liquidity pool at £211bn (December 2018: 
£227bn) reflects the Group's prudent 
approach to liquidity management. The 
Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) remained well 
above the 100% regulatory requirement at 
160% (December 2018: 169%), equivalent to 
a surplus of £78bn (December 2018: £90bn). 
The liquidity pool, LCR and surplus have been 
managed down through the course of the 
year, supporting increased business funding 
requirements while maintaining a prudent 
liquidity position.

During the year, the Group issued £8.6bn 
of minimum requirement for own funds 
and eligible liabilities (MREL) instruments 
in a range of tenors and currencies.

Barclays Bank PLC continued to issue in the 
shorter-term markets and Barclays Bank UK 
PLC issued in the shorter-term and secured 
markets, helping to maintain their stable 
and diversified funding bases. 

The Group has continued to reduce its 
reliance on short-term wholesale funding, 
where the proportion maturing in less than 
one year fell to 28% (December 2018: 30%).

Liquidity risk stress testing 
Under the Liquidity Framework, the Group 
has established a liquidity risk appetite (LRA) 
together with the appropriate limits for the 
management of the liquidity risk. This is the 
level of liquidity risk the Group chooses to 
take in pursuit of its business objectives and in 
meeting its regulatory obligations. The Group 
sets its internal liquidity risk appetite (LRA) 
based on internal liquidity risk assessments 
and external regulatory requirements, namely 
the CRR (as amended by CRR II) Liquidity 
Coverage Ratio (LCR).

Liquidity risk appetite 
The liquidity risk assessment measures the 
potential contractual and contingent stress 
outflows under a range of stress scenarios, 
which are then used to determine the size of 
the liquidity pool that is immediately available 
to meet anticipated outflows should a stress 
occur.

As part of the LRA, the Group runs three 
short-term liquidity stress scenarios, aligned 
to the PRA's prescribed stresses:

■■ 90-day market-wide stress event
■■ 30-day Barclays-specific stress event
■■ combined 30-day market-wide and 

Barclays-specific stress event.

Liquidity risk
All disclosures in this section 
(pages 180 to 189) are unaudited 
unless otherwise stated.

Overview
The Group has a comprehensive 
key risk control framework for 
managing the Group's liquidity risk. 
The Liquidity Framework meets the 
PRA's standards and is designed to 
maintain liquidity resources that are 
sufficient in amount and quality, and a 
funding profile that is appropriate to 
meet the liquidity risk appetite. The 
Liquidity Framework is delivered via a 
combination of policy formation, 
review and governance, analysis, 
stress testing, limit setting and 
monitoring.

This section provides an analysis 
of the Group's: (i) summary of 
performance; (ii) liquidity risk stress 
testing; iii) liquidity pool; (iv) funding 
structure and funding relationships; 
(v) credit ratings; and (vi) contractual 
maturity of financial assets and 
liabilities. 

For further detail on liquidity risk 
governance and framework, refer

PLC Pillar 3 Report 2019 (unaudited).

Key LRA assumptions

For the year ended 31 December 2019

Drivers of Liquidity risk LRA Combined stress – key assumptions

Wholesale Secured and Unsecured Funding Risk ■■ Zero rollover of maturing wholesale unsecured funding
■■ Loss of repo capacity on non-extremely liquid repos at contractual maturity date
■■ Roll of repo for extremely liquid repo at wider haircut at contractual maturity date
■■ Withdrawal of contractual buy-back obligations, excess client futures margin, 

Prime Brokerage (PB) client cash and overlifts
■■ Haircuts applied to the market value of marketable assets held in the liquidity buffer

Retail and Corporate Funding Risk ■■ Retail and Corporate deposit outflows as counterparties seek to diversify their 
deposit balances

Intraday Liquidity Risk ■■ Liquidity held to meet increased intraday liquidity usage due to payment and receipts 
volatility, loss of unsecured credit lines and haircuts applied to collateral values used to back 
secured credit lines in a stress

Intra-Group Liquidity Risk ■■ Liquidity support for material subsidiaries. Surplus liquidity held within certain subsidiaries 
is not taken as a benefit to the wider Group

Cross-Currency Liquidity Risk ■■ Deterioration in FX market capacity that may result in restriction in net currency positions

Off-Balance Sheet Liquidity Risk
 
 
 
 

■■ Drawdown on committed facilities based on facility and counterparty type
■■ Collateral outflows due to a two-notch credit rating downgrade
■■ Increase in the Group's initial margin requirement across all major exchanges
■■ Variation margin outflows from collateralised risk positions
■■ Outflow of collateral owing but not called
■■ Loss of internal sources of funding within the PB synthetics business

Franchise-Viability Risk ■■ Liquidity held to enable the firm to meet select non-contractual obligations to ensure market 
confidence in the firm is maintained, including debt buy-backs, swap tear-ups and increased 
prime brokerage margin debits

Funding Concentration Risk ■■ Liquidity held against largest wholesale funding counterparty refusing to roll

As at 31 December 2019, the Group held eligible liquid assets well in excess of 100% of net stress outflows of the 30-day combined scenario, 
which has the highest net outflows of the three short-term liquidity stress scenarios.

The Group also runs a long-term liquidity stress test, which measures the anticipated outflows over a 12-month market-wide scenario. 
As at 31 December 2019, the Group remained compliant with this internal metric.

Liquidity regulation
The Group monitors its position against the CRR (as amended by CRR II) Liquidity Coverage Ratio and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR).

The LCR is designed to promote short-term resilience of a bank's liquidity risk profile by holding sufficient High Quality Liquid Assets to survive 
an acute stress scenario lasting for 30 days. The NSFR has been developed to promote a sustainable maturity structure of assets and liabilities.

In June 2019, the EBA published CRR II which defined the final rules and minimum requirements for the NSFR. Barclays expects to be compliant 
with these requirements when they become effective in June 2021.

Liquidity coverage ratio
The external LCR requirement is prescribed by the regulator taking into account the relative stability of different sources of funding and potential 
incremental funding requirements in a stress. 

As at 31 December
2019

2018
£bn

Eligible liquidity buffer 206 219
Net stress outflows (128) (129)
Surplus 78 90
Liquidity coverage ratio 160% 169%

As part of the LRA, Barclays also establishes the minimum LCR limit. The Group plans to maintain its surplus to the internal and regulatory stress 
requirements at an efficient level, while continuously assessing risks to market funding conditions and its liquidity position and taking actions to 
manage the size of the liquidity pool as appropriate.

RISK REVIEW: TREASURY AND CAPITAL RISK

 Risk performance

Liquidity pool 
The Group liquidity pool as at 31 December 2019 was £211bn (2018: £227bn). During 2019, the month-end liquidity pool ranged from £211bn 
to £256bn (2018: £207bn to £243bn), and the month-end average balance was £235bn (2018: £225bn). The liquidity pool is held unencumbered 
and is intended to offset stress outflows. It comprises the following cash and unencumbered assets.

c The LCR eligible liquidity pool is adjusted for trapped liquidity and other regulatory deductions. It also incorporates other CRR (as amended by CRR II) qualifying assets that are 

not eligible under Barclays' internal risk appetite.

The Group liquidity pool is well diversified by major currency and the Group monitors LRA stress scenarios for major currencies.

Management of the liquidity pool
The composition of the liquidity pool is subject to limits set by the Board and the independent liquidity risk, credit risk and market risk functions. 
In addition, the investment of the liquidity pool is monitored for concentration risk by issuer, currency and asset type. Given the returns generated 
by these highly liquid assets, the risk and reward profile is continuously managed.

As at 31 December 2019, 67% (2018: 70%) of the liquidity pool was located in Barclays Bank PLC, 20% (2018: 20%) in Barclays Bank UK PLC and 
6% (2018: 2%) in Barclays Bank Ireland PLC. The residual portion of the liquidity pool is held outside of these entities, predominantly in the US 
subsidiaries, to meet entity-specific stress outflows and local regulatory requirements. To the extent the use of this portion of the liquidity pool 
is restricted due to local regulatory requirements, it is assumed to be unavailable to the rest of the Group in calculating the LCR.

Contingent liquidity
In addition to the Group liquidity pool, the Group has access to other unencumbered assets which provide a source of contingent liquidity. 
While these are not relied on in the Group's LRA, a portion of these assets may be monetised in a stress to generate liquidity through their use 
as collateral for secured funding or through outright sale.

In a Barclays-specific, market-wide or combined liquidity stress, liquidity available via market sources could be severely disrupted. In 
circumstances where market liquidity is unavailable or available only at significantly elevated prices, the Group could generate liquidity via central 
bank facilities. The Group maintains a significant amount of collateral positioned at central banks.

For more detail on the Group's other unencumbered assets, see pages 221 to 222 of the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2019 (unaudited).

Funding structure and funding relationships
The basis for sound liquidity risk management is a funding structure that reduces the probability of a liquidity stress leading to an inability to 
meet funding obligations as they fall due. The Group's overall funding strategy is to develop a diversified funding base (geographically, by type 
and by counterparty) and maintain access to a variety of alternative funding sources, to provide protection against unexpected fluctuations, 
while minimising the cost of funding.

Within this, the Group aims to align the sources and uses of funding. As such, retail and corporate loans and advances are largely funded by 
deposits in the relevant entities, with the surplus primarily funding the liquidity pool. The majority of reverse repurchase agreements are matched 
by repurchase agreements. Derivative liabilities and assets are largely matched. A substantial proportion of balance sheet derivative positions 
qualify for counterparty netting and the remaining portions are largely offset when netted against cash collateral received and paid. Wholesale 
debt and equity is used to fund residual assets.

These funding relationships are summarised below:

Note
a The loan: deposit ratio is calculated as loans and advances at amortised cost divided by deposits at amortised cost.

As at 31 December 2019, £181bn (2018: £172bn) of total customer deposits were insured through the UK Financial Services Compensation 
Scheme (FSCS) and other similar schemes. In addition to these customer deposits £4bn (2018: £5bn) of other liabilities are insured by other 
governments.

Contractually, current accounts are repayable on demand and savings accounts at short notice. In practice, their observed maturity is typically 
longer than their contractual maturity. Similarly, repayment profiles of certain types of assets e.g. mortgages, overdrafts and credit card lending, 
differ from their contractual profiles. The Group therefore assesses the behavioural maturity of both customer assets and liabilities to identify 
structural balance sheet funding gaps. In doing so, it applies quantitative modelling and qualitative assessments which take into account historical 
experience, current customer composition and macroeconomic projections.

The Group's broad base of customers, numerically and by depositor type, helps protect against unexpected fluctuations in balances and hence 
provides a stable funding base for the Group's operations and liquidity needs.

RISK REVIEW: TREASURY AND CAPITAL RISK

 Risk performance

Wholesale funding
Barclays Bank Group and Barclays Bank UK Group maintain access to a variety of sources of wholesale funds in major currencies, including 
those available from term investors across a variety of distribution channels and geographies, short-term funding markets and repo markets. 

Barclays Bank Group has direct access to US, European and Asian capital markets through its global investment banking operations and to 
long-term investors through its clients worldwide. Key sources of wholesale funding include money markets, certificates of deposit, commercial 
paper, medium term issuances (including structured notes) and securitisations.

Key sources of wholesale funding for Barclays Bank UK Group include money markets, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, covered bonds 
and other securitisations.

The Group expects to continue issuing public wholesale debt from Barclays PLC (the Parent company), in order to maintain compliance with 
indicative MREL requirements and maintain a stable and diverse funding base by type, currency and market.

As at 31 December 2019, the Group's total wholesale funding outstanding (excluding repurchase agreements) was £147.1bn (2018: £154.0bn), 
of which £19.6bn (2018: £22.5bn) was secured funding and £127.5bn (2018: £131.5bn) unsecured funding. Unsecured funding includes 
£51.1bn (2018: £47.3bn) of privately placed senior unsecured notes issued through a variety of distribution channels including intermediaries 
and private banks.

During the year, the Group issued £8.6bn of minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) instruments from Barclays PLC 
(the Parent company) in a range of different currencies and tenors. Barclays Bank PLC continued to issue in the shorter-term markets and 
Barclays Bank UK PLC issued in the shorter-term and secured markets, helping to maintain their stable and diversified funding bases. 

As at 31 December 2019, wholesale funding of £40.6bn (2018: £46.7bn) matures in less than one year, of which £16.3bn (2018: £19.1bn) relates 
to term funding. Although not a requirement, the liquidity pool exceeded the wholesale funding maturing in less than one year by £170bn 
(2018: £180bn).

Barclays Bank Group and Barclays Bank UK Group also support various central bank monetary initiatives including participation in the Bank of 
England's Term Funding Scheme. These are reported under ‘repurchase agreements and other similar secured borrowing' on the balance sheet.

To manage cross currency refinancing risk, the Group manages to foreign exchange cash flow limits, which limit risk at specific maturities. 

Credit ratings
In addition to monitoring and managing key metrics related to the financial strength of the Group, Barclays also solicits independent credit ratings 
from Standard & Poor's Global (S&P), Moody's, Fitch, and Rating and Investment Information (R&I). These ratings assess the creditworthiness 
of the Group, its subsidiaries and its branches, and are based on reviews of a broad range of business and financial attributes including capital 
strength, profitability, funding, liquidity, asset quality, strategy and governance.

Credit ratings
As at 30 January 2020 Standard & Poor's Moody's Fitch
Barclays Bank PLC
Long-term A / Stable A1 / Stable A+ / Stable
Short-term A-1 P-1 F1
Barclays Bank UK PLC
Long-term A / Stable A1 / Negative A+ / Stable
Short-term A-1 P-1 F1
Barclays PLC
Long-term BBB / Stable Baa2 /Stable A / Stable
Short-term A-2 P-2 F1

In January 2020 Moody's upgraded the long-term ratings of Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC by one notch to Baa2 and A1 respectively, 
due to their view that the earnings profile of the entities has improved. This followed the positive outlooks that had been placed on these entities 
in May 2019 and the outlooks reverted to stable in the most recent action. In November 2019, Moody's revised the outlook on Barclays Bank 
UK PLC to negative from stable, alongside other UK peers following a negative revision to the UK sovereign outlook.

In June 2019, Fitch affirmed all ratings for Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Bank UK PLC. In December 2019, Fitch placed the outlooks 
of all entities on stable from rating watch negative (RWN) alongside 18 UK banks to reflect their view that the immediate risk of a disruptive 
no deal Brexit scenario was removed. 

In June 2019, S&P affirmed all ratings for Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Bank UK PLC.

Barclays also solicits issuer ratings from R&I and the ratings of A- for Barclays PLC and A for Barclays Bank PLC were affirmed in November 2019 
with stable outlooks.

A credit rating downgrade could result in outflows to meet collateral requirements on existing contracts. Outflows related to credit rating 
downgrades are included in the LRA stress scenarios and a portion of the liquidity pool is held against this risk. Credit ratings downgrades could 
also result in reduced funding capacity and increased funding costs.

The contractual collateral requirement following one- and two-notch long-term and associated short-term downgrades across all credit rating 
agencies, would result in outflows of £4bn and £5bn respectively, and are provided for in the liquidity pool given the Group's liquidity risk appetite. 
These numbers do not assume any management or restructuring actions that could be taken to reduce posting requirements. These outflows do 
not include the potential liquidity impact from loss of unsecured funding, such as from money market funds, or loss of secured funding capacity. 
However, unsecured and secured funding stresses are included in the LRA stress scenarios and a portion of the liquidity pool is held against 
these risks.

Contractual maturity of financial assets and liabilities 
The table below provides detail on the contractual maturity of all financial instruments and other assets and liabilities. Derivatives (other than 
those designated in a hedging relationship) and trading portfolio assets and liabilities are included in the ‘on demand' column at their fair value. 
Liquidity risk on these items is not managed on the basis of contractual maturity since they are not held for settlement according to such maturity 
and will frequently be settled before contractual maturity at fair value. Derivatives designated in a hedging relationship are included according to 
their contractual maturity.

Expected maturity date may differ from the contractual dates, to account for:

■■ trading portfolio assets and liabilities and derivative financial instruments, which may not be held to maturity as part of the Group's trading 
strategies

■■ corporate and retail deposits, reported under deposits at amortised cost, are repayable on demand or at short notice on a contractual basis. 
In practice, their behavioural maturity is typically longer than their contractual maturity, and therefore these deposits provide stable funding for 
the Group's operations and liquidity needs because of the broad base of customers, both numerically and by depositor type

■■ loans to corporate and retail customers, which are included within loans and advances at amortised cost and financial assets at fair value, 
may be repaid earlier in line with terms and conditions of the contract

■■ debt securities in issue, subordinated liabilities, and financial liabilities designated at fair value, may include early redemption features.

RISK REVIEW: TREASURY AND CAPITAL RISK

 Risk performance

Summary of performance 
in the period
The Group continues to be in excess of overall 
capital requirements, minimum leverage 
requirements and minimum requirements 
for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL).

The CET1 ratio ended the year at 13.8% 
(December 2018: 13.2%).

CET1 capital decreased by £0.3bn to £40.8bn. 
This was driven by underlying profit generation 
of £5.0bn offset by dividends paid and 
foreseen of £2.4bn, the additional provision 
for PPI of £1.4bn, pension deficit reduction 
contribution payments of £0.5bn, a decrease 
in the currency translation reserve of £0.5bn 
mainly driven by the depreciation of period 
end USD against GBP and a loss on the 
redemption of Additional Tier 1 (AT1) 
securities of £0.4bn.

RWAs decreased by £16.8bn to £295.1bn 
primarily driven by the reduction in the 
Group's operational risk RWAs as well as the 
depreciation of period end USD against GBP.

The average UK leverage ratio remained stable 
at 4.5% (December 2018: 4.5%) primarily 
driven by a net increase in AT1 capital, offset 
by a modest increase in leverage exposure to 
£1,143bn (December 2018: £1,110bn). The UK 
leverage ratio remained stable at 5.1% 
(December 2018: 5.1%).

Overall capital requirements
The Group's Overall Capital Requirement 
for CET1 is 12.1% comprising a 4.5% Pillar 1 
minimum, a 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer 
(CCB), a 1.5% Global Systemically Important 
Institution (G-SII) buffer, a 3.0% Pillar 2A 
requirement and a 0.6% Countercyclical 
Capital Buffer (CCyB).

The Group's CCyB is based on the buffer rate 
applicable for each jurisdiction in which the 
Group has exposures. On 28 November 2018, 
the Financial Policy Committee (FPC) set the 
CCyB rate for UK exposures at 1%. The buffer 
rates set by other national authorities for 
non-UK exposures are not currently material. 
Overall, this results in a 0.6% CCyB for the 
Group for Q419. On 16 December 2019, the 
FPC announced its intention to increase the 
CCyB rate for UK exposures from 1% to 2%. 
This will take effect from December 2020 and, 
based on current UK exposures, is expected 
to increase the Group's CCyB to 
approximately 1.1%.

The Group's Pillar 2A requirement as per the 
PRA's Individual Capital Requirement is 5.4% 
of which at least 56.25% needs to be met with 
CET1 capital, equating to approximately 3.0% 
of RWAs. Certain elements of the Pillar 2A 
requirement are a fixed quantum whilst others 
are a proportion of RWAs, based on a point in 
time assessment. The Pillar 2A requirement 
is subject to at least annual review.

On 27 June 2019, CRR II came into force 
amending CRR. As an amending regulation, 
the existing provisions of CRR apply unless 
they are amended by CRR II. 

Certain provisions took immediate effect and 
these primarily relate to MREL. Amendments 
within the capital risk section include changes 
to qualifying criteria for CET1, AT1 and Tier 2 
instruments, the inclusion of additional 
holdings eligible for deduction, an 
amendment to the treatment of deferred tax 
assets and the introduction of requirements 
for MREL. Grandfathering and transitional 
provisions relating to MREL have also been 
introduced. Other CRR II amendments are 
expected to take effect from 28 June 2021. 

Certain aspects of CRR II are dependent on 
final technical standards to be issued by the 
European Banking Authority (EBA) and 
adopted by the European Commission as well 
as UK implementation of the rules. The 
disclosures in the following section reflect 
Barclays' interpretation of the current rules 
and guidance. 

Minimum leverage ratio 
requirements
The Group is subject to a leverage ratio 
requirement of 4.0% as at 31 December 2019. 
This comprises the 3.25% minimum 
requirement, a G-SII additional leverage ratio 
buffer (G-SII ALRB) of 0.53% and a 
countercyclical leverage ratio buffer (CCLB) of 
0.2%. Although the leverage ratio is expressed 
in terms of Tier 1 (T1) capital, 75% of the 
minimum requirement, equating to 2.4375%, 
needs to be met with CET1 capital. In addition, 
the G-SII ALRB and CCLB must be covered 
solely with CET1 capital. The CET1 capital held 
against the 0.53% G-SII ALRB was £6.0bn and 
against the 0.2% CCLB was £2.3bn. 

MREL
The Group is required to meet the higher of: 
(i) the MREL set by the Bank of England; and 
(ii) the requirements in CRR II, both of which 
have RWA and leverage based requirements. 
MREL is subject to phased implementation 
and will be fully implemented by 1 January 
2022, at which time the Group's indicative 
MREL is expected to be two times the sum of 
its Pillar 1 and Pillar 2A requirements, as set by 
the Bank of England. In addition, CET1 capital 
cannot be counted towards both MREL and 
the capital buffers, meaning that the buffers 
will effectively be applied above both the 
Pillar 1 and Pillar 2A requirements relating 
to own funds and eligible liabilities. The Bank 
of England will review the MREL calibration 
by the end of 2020, including assessing the 
proposal for Pillar 2A recapitalisation, which 
may drive a different 1 January 2022 MREL 
than currently proposed.

Capital risk
All disclosures in this section 
(pages 190-197) are unaudited unless 
otherwise stated.

Overview
The CET1 ratio, among other metrics, 
is a measure of the capital strength 
and resilience of Barclays. 
Maintenance of our capital resources 
is vital in order to meet the overall 
capital requirement, and to cover 
the Group's current and forecast 
business needs, and associated 
risks in order to provide a viable 
and sustainable business offering. 

This section provides an overview of 
the Group's: (i) CET1 capital, leverage 
and own funds and eligible liabilities 
requirements; (ii) capital resources; 
(iii) risk weighted assets (RWAs); (iv) 
leverage ratios and exposures; and (v) 
own funds and eligible liabilities.

More details on monitoring and 
managing capital risk may be found 
in the risk management sections on 
pages 194 to 196 of the Barclays PLC 
Pillar 3 Report 2019 (unaudited).

Notes
a CET1, T1 and T2 capital, and RWAs are calculated applying the transitional arrangements of the CRR as amended by CRR II applicable as at the reporting date. This includes IFRS 9 

transitional arrangements and the grandfathering of CRR and CRR II non-compliant capital instruments. 
b The fully loaded CET1 ratio, as is relevant for assessing against the conversion trigger in Barclays PLC AT1 securities, was 13.5%, with £39.7bn of CET1 capital and £295.0bn of RWAs 

calculated without applying the transitional arrangements of the CRR as amended by CRR II applicable as at the reporting date.
c The Group's CET1 ratio, as is relevant for assessing against the conversion trigger in Barclays Bank PLC T2 Contingent Capital Notes, was 13.8%. For this calculation CET1 capital 

and RWAs are calculated applying the transitional arrangements under the CRR, including the IFRS 9 transitional arrangements. The benefit of the Financial Services Authority (FSA) 
October 2012 interpretation of the transitional provisions, relating to the implementation of CRD IV, expired in December 2017.

£3.3bn of capital generated from profits was partially offset by £2.4bn of regulatory dividends paid and foreseen including £0.8bn of AT1 coupons 
paid. Other movements in the period were:

■■ a £0.5bn decrease in the currency translation reserve mainly driven by the depreciation of period end USD against GBP
■■ a £0.5bn decrease as a result of movements relating to pensions, largely due to deficit contribution payments of £0.25bn in April 2019 

and September 2019
■■ a £0.4bn loss on the redemption of AT1 securities 
■■ a £0.2bn decrease in the IFRS 9 transitional add back primarily due to the change in the phasing of transitional relief from 95% in 2018 

to 85% in 2019.

the standardised approach

■■ ‘book quality' decreased RWAs £2.6bn primarily due to changes in risk profile
■■ ‘model updates' increased RWAs £2.0bn primarily due to the recalibration of modelled wholesale RWAs
■■ ‘methodology and policy' decreased RWAs £13.9bn primarily due to removal of the operational risk floor
■■ ‘foreign exchange movements' decreased RWAs by £2.9bn primarily due to the depreciation of period end USD against GBP.

The average UK leverage ratio remained stable at 4.5% (December 2018: 4.5%). T1 capital increased £1.4bn to £51.8bn, which included a net 
increase in AT1 capital, partially offset by a modest increase in exposure of £33bn to £1,143bn primarily driven by SFTs and weighted off-balance 
sheet commitments.

The UK leverage ratio also remained stable at 5.1% (December 2018: 5.1%). T1 capital increased £1.0bn to £51.6bn, which included a net increase 
in AT1 capital. The UK leverage exposure increased £9bn to £1,008bn primarily driven by loans and advances and other assets. 

The difference between the average UK leverage ratio and the UK leverage ratio was primarily driven by lower trading portfolio assets, settlement 
exposures and SFT exposures at quarter end.

The Group also discloses a CRR leverage ratioa within its additional regulatory disclosures prepared in accordance with EBA guidelines on 
disclosure under Part Eight of the CRR (see Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2019 (unaudited), due to be published on 13 February 2020 and which will

RISK REVIEW: TREASURY AND CAPITAL RISK

 Risk performance

Foreign exchange risk (audited)
The Group is exposed to two sources of foreign exchange risk.

a) Transactional foreign currency exposure
Transactional foreign currency exposures represent exposure on banking assets and liabilities, denominated in currencies other than the 
functional currency of the transacting entity.

The Group's risk management policies are designed to prevent the holding of significant open positions in foreign currencies outside the trading 
portfolio managed by Barclays International which is monitored through VaR.

Banking book transactional foreign exchange risk outside of Barclays International is monitored on a daily basis by the market risk function and 
minimised by the businesses.

b) Translational foreign exchange exposure
The Group's investments in overseas subsidiaries and branches create capital resources denominated in foreign currencies, principally USD and 
EUR. Changes in the GBP value of the net investments due to foreign currency movements are captured in the currency translation reserve, 
resulting in a movement in CET1 capital.

The Group's strategy is to minimise the volatility of the capital ratios caused by foreign exchange movements, by matching the CET1 capital 
movements to the revaluation of the Group's foreign currency RWA exposures.

Economic hedges relate to exposures arising on foreign currency denominated preference share and AT1 instruments. These are accounted 
for at historical cost under IFRS and do not qualify as hedges for accounting purposes. The gain or loss arising from changes in the GBP value 
of these instruments is recognised on redemption in retained earnings.

During 2019, total structural currency exposure net of hedging instruments increased by £1.8bn to £13.6bn (2018: £11.8bn). Foreign currency 
net investments decreased by £2.8bn to £31.2bn (2018: £34.0bn) driven predominantly by a £3.2bn decrease in USD offset by a £0.4bn increase 
in EUR. The hedges associated with these investments decreased by £4.1bn to £11.2bn (2018: £15.3bn).

Pension risk review
The UK Retirement Fund (UKRF) represents approximately 97% (2018: 97%) of the Group's total retirement benefit obligations globally. As such 
this risk review section focuses exclusively on the UKRF. The UKRF is closed to new entrants and there is no new final salary benefit being accrued. 
Existing active members accrue a combination of a cash balance benefit and a defined contribution element. Pension risk arises as the market 
value of the pension fund assets may decline, investment returns may reduce or the estimated value of the pension liabilities may increase.

Refer to page 196 of the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2019 (unaudited) for more information on how pension risk is managed.

Assets
The Trustee Board of the UKRF defines its overall long-term investment strategy with investments across a broad range of asset classes. 
This results in an appropriate mix of return seeking assets as well as liability matching assets to better match future pension obligations. 
The two largest market risks within the asset portfolio are interest rates and equities. The split of scheme assets is shown within Note 33. 
The fair value of the UKRF assets was £31.4bn as at 31 December 2019 (2018: £29.0bn).

Liabilities
The UKRF retirement benefit obligations are a series of future cash flows with relatively long duration. On an IAS 19 basis these cash flows 
are sensitive to changes in the expected long-term price inflation rate (RPI) and the discount rate (GBP AA corporate bond yield):

■■ an increase in long-term expected inflation corresponds to an increase in liabilities
■■ a decrease in the discount rate corresponds to an increase in liabilities.

Pension risk is generated through the Group's defined benefit schemes and this risk is set to reduce over time as the main defined benefit scheme 
is closed to new entrants. The chart below outlines the shape of the UKRF's liability cash flow profile as at 31 December 2019 that takes account 
of the future inflation indexing of payments to beneficiaries. The majority of the cash flows (approximately 93%) fall between 0 and 40 years, 
peaking between 11 and 20 years and reducing thereafter. The shape may vary depending on changes to inflation and longevity expectations 
and any members who elect to transfer out. Transfers out will bring forward the liability cash flows.

For more detail on the UKRF's financial and demographic assumptions see Note 33 to the financial statements.

The graph above shows the evolution of the UKRF's net IAS 19 position over the last two years. During 2019 the net improvement in the IAS 19 
position was largely driven by bank contributions. Credit spreads tightening during the year had a negative impact which was broadly offset by 
changes in other market levels, in particular equity prices and interest rates, and updates to demographic assumptions.

Refer to Note 33 for the sensitivity of the UKRF to changes in key assumptions.

Risk measurement
In line with Barclays' risk management framework the assets and liabilities of the UKRF are modelled within a VaR framework to show the volatility 
of the pension position at a total portfolio level. This enables the risks, diversification and liability matching characteristics of the UKRF obligations 
and investments to be adequately captured. VaR is measured and monitored on a monthly basis. Risks are reviewed and reported regularly at 
forums including the Board Risk Committee, the Group Risk Committee, the Pensions Management Group and the Pension Executive Board. 
The VaR model takes into account the valuation of the liabilities on an IAS 19 basis (see Note 33). The Trustee receives quarterly VaR measures 
on a funding basis.

The pension liability is also sensitive to post-retirement mortality assumptions which are reviewed regularly. See Note 33 for more details.

In addition, the impact of pension risk to the Group is taken into account as part of the stress testing process. Stress testing is performed internally 
on at least an annual basis. The UKRF exposure is also included as part of regulatory stress tests. 

Barclays defined benefit pension schemes affects capital in two ways:

■■ an IAS 19 deficit is treated as a liability on the Group's balance sheet. Movement in a deficit due to remeasurements, including actuarial losses, 
are recognised immediately through Other Comprehensive Income and as such reduces shareholders' equity and CET1 capital. An IAS 19 
surplus is treated as an asset on the balance sheet and increases shareholders' equity; however, it is deducted for the purposes of determining 
CET1 capital

■■ in the Group's statutory balance sheet an IAS 19 surplus or deficit is partially offset by a deferred tax liability or asset respectively. These may 
or may not be recognised for calculating CET1 capital depending on the overall deferred tax position of the Group at the particular time.

Pension risk is taken into account in the Pillar 2A capital assessment undertaken by the PRA at least annually. The Pillar 2A requirement forms 
part of the Group's Overall Capital Requirement for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital. More detail on minimum regulatory requirements 
can be found on page 195.

RISK REVIEW: TREASURY AND CAPITAL RISK

 Risk performance

Summary of performance 
in the period
Annual Earnings at Risk (AEaR), is a key 
measure of interest rate risk in the banking 
book (IRRBB).

Net interest income sensitivity
The table below shows a sensitivity analysis 
on pre-tax net interest income for non-traded 
financial assets and liabilities, including the 
effect of any hedging. NII sensitivity uses the 
Annual Earnings at Risk (AEaR) metric as 
described on page 196 of the Barclays PLC 
Pillar 3 Report 2019 (unaudited).

Note that this metric assumes an 
instantaneous parallel change to forward 
interest rate curves. The model does not apply 
floors to shocked market rates, but does 
recognise contractual product specific interest 
rate floors where relevant. The main model 
assumptions are: (i) one-year ahead time 
horizon; (ii) balance sheet is held constant; 
(iii) balances are adjusted for assumed 
behavioural profiles (i.e. considers that 
customers may prepay the mortgages before 
the contractual maturity); and (iv) behavioural 
assumptions are kept unchanged in all rate 
scenarios.

c The Group's customer banking book hedging activity is risk reducing from an NII sensitivity perspective. The hedges in 

place remove interest rate risk and smooth income over the medium term. The NII sensitivity for the Group at 
31 December 2019 without hedging in place for +/-25bp rate shocks would be £140m/£(229)m respectively.

d NII sensitivity for December 2018 restated due to increased portfolio coverage, primarily the inclusion of the Treasury 
portfolio.

NII asymmetry arises due to the current low level of interest rates as some customer product have embedded floors. NII sensitivity to a +25bp 
shock to rates has decreased year on year resulting from actions taken to reduce the exposure to falling interest rates and increased bond holding 
outright in the liquidity pool.

Overview
The treasury and capital risk 
framework covers interest rate 
sensitive exposures held in 
the banking book, mostly relating 
to accrual accounted and FVOCI 
instruments. The potential volatility of 
net interest income is measured by an 
Annual Earnings at Risk (AEaR) metric 
which is monitored regularly and 
reported to senior management and 
the Barclays PLC Board Risk 
Committee as part of the limit 
monitoring framework.

For further detail on the interest rate 
risk in the banking book governance 
and framework refer to pages 196

Analysis of equity sensitivity
Equity sensitivity measures the overall impact of a +/- 25bps movement in interest rates on retained earnings, fair value through other 
comprehensive income (FVOCI), cash flow hedge reserves and pensions. For non-NII items a DV01 metric is used, which is an indicator 
of the shift in value for a one basis point movement in the yield curve.

Movements in the FVOCI reserve impact CET1 capital. However, movements in the cash flow hedge reserve and pensions remeasurement reserve 
recognised in FVOCI do not affect CET1 capital. 

Volatility of the FVOCI portfolio in the liquidity pool 
Changes in value of FVOCI exposures flow directly through capital via the FVOCI reserve. The volatility of the value of the FVOCI investments 
in the liquidity pool is captured and managed through a value measure rather than an earning measure, i.e. non-traded market risk VaR.

Although the underlying methodology to calculate the non-traded VaR is identical to the one used in traded management VaR, the two measures 
are not directly comparable. The non-traded VaR represents the volatility to capital driven by the FVOCI exposures. These exposures are in the 
banking book and do not meet the criteria for trading book treatment.

RISK REVIEW: OPERATIONAL RISK

 Risk performance

Summary of performance 
in the period
During 2019, total operational risk lossesa 
decreased to £169m (2018: £230m) and the 
number of recorded events for 2019 (2,098) 
was at the same level as 2018 (2,068). The 
total operational risk losses for the year were 
mainly driven by events falling within the 
Execution, Delivery and Process Management 
and External Fraud categories, which tend to 
be high volume but low impact events.

Operational risk profile
Within operational risk, there are a large 
number of small risk events. In 2019, 84% 
(2018: 84%) of the Group's reportable 
operational risk events by volume had a value 
of less than £50,000 each. Cumulatively, 
events under this £50,000 threshold 
accounted for only 19% (2018: 14%) of the 
Group's total net operational risk losses. 
A small proportion of operational risk events 
have a material impact on the financial results 
of the Group. 

All disclosures in this section are 
unaudited unless otherwise stated.

Overview
Operational risks are inherent in the 
Group's business activities and it is not 
cost effective or possible to attempt to 
eliminate all operational risks. The 
Operational Risk Framework is therefore 
focused on identifying operational risks, 
assessing them and managing them 
within the Group's approved risk 
appetite. 

The Operational Risk principal risk 
comprises the following risks: Data 
Management & Information Risk; 
Financial Reporting Risk; Fraud Risk; 
Payments Process Risk; People Risk; 
Premises Risk; Physical Security Risk; 
Supplier Risk; Tax Risk; Technology 
Risk; Transaction Operations Risk and 
Execution Risk. The operational risk 
profile is also informed by a number of 
risk themes: Cyber, Data and Resilience. 
These represent threats to the Group 
that extend across multiple risk types, 
and therefore require an integrated risk 
management approach.

For definitions of these risks refer to 
pages 199 to 200 of the Barclays PLC 
Pillar 3 Report 2019. In order to provide 
complete coverage of the potential 
adverse impacts on the Group arising 
from operational risk, the operational 
risk taxonomy extends beyond the risks 
listed above to cover operational risks 
associated with other principal risks 
too.

This section provides an analysis of the 
Group's operational risk profile, 
including events above the Group's 
reportable threshold, which have had a 
financial impact in 2019. The Group's 
operational risk profile is informed by 
bottom-up risk assessments 
undertaken by each business unit and 
top-down qualitative review by the 
Operational Risk specialists for each 
risk type. Fraud, Transaction Operations 
and Technology continue to be 
highlighted as key operational risk 
exposures. 

For information on conduct risk events 
see page 203.

■■ Execution, Delivery and Process 
Management impacts decreased to £101m 
(2018: £130m) and accounted for 60% 
(2018: 57%) of total operational risk losses. 
The events in this category are typical of 
the banking industry as a whole where 
high volumes of transactions are 
processed on a daily basis, mapping mainly 
to Barclays Transaction Operations risk 
type. The overall frequency of events in 
this category remained stable year on year 
at 28% of total events by volume 
(2018: 31%).

■■ External Fraud remains the category with 
the highest frequency of events at 67% of 
total events in 2019 (2018: 62%). In this 
category, high volume, low value events 
are driven by transactional fraud often 
related to debit and credit card usage. 
Ratio of losses in this category increased 
to 28% of total 2019 losses (2018: 21%), 
driven mainly by increased fraud attacks 
on the Group's systems following 
implementation of Cheque Imaging 
as part of the clearing process. 

■■ Business Disruption and System Failures 
accounted for an increased share at 11% 
of total impacts (2018: 6%), although 
actual losses remained broadly stable at 
£18m (2018: £14m) and volume of events 
fell slightly to 86 (2018: 99).

■■ Employment Practices and Workplace 
Safety impacts show a significant decrease 
to £1m (2018: £35m) accounting for 0.4% 
of total operational risk losses in 2019 
(2018: 15%), while volume of events in 
this category also decreased to 17 in 2019 
(2018: 46). The 2018 loss was mainly 
incurred from a low number of events with 
significant impacts (three single legacy 
events relating to closed businesses 
accounted for 90% of total impacts).

RISK REVIEW: OPERATIONAL RISK

 Risk performance

Investment continues to be made in improving 
the control environment across the Group. 
Particular areas of focus include new and 
enhanced fraud prevention systems and tools 
to combat the increasing level of fraud 
attempts being made and to minimise any 
disruption to genuine transactions. Fraud 
remains an industry-wide threat and the 
Group continues to work closely with external 
partners on various prevention initiatives. 

Operational resilience is a key area of focus 
for the Group. Disruption to our business 
activities is a material inherent risk within 
the Group and across the financial services 
industry, whether arising through impacts 
on our technology systems, our real estate 
services, availability of personnel or services 
supplied by third parties. Failure to build 
resilience and recovery capabilities into our 
business activities may result in significant 
customer detriment, costs to reimburse losses 
incurred by the Group's customers, market 
impact and reputational damage. In common 
with the rest of the Financial Services industry, 
the Group expects continued regulatory 
scrutiny in relation to resilience. Technology, 
resilience and cybersecurity risks evolve 
rapidly so the Group maintains continued 
focus and investment in our control 
environment to manage these risks, and 
actively partners with peers and relevant 
organisations to understand and disrupt 
threats originating outside the Group.

Cyberattacks are a global threat that are 
inherent across all industries. The financial 
sector remains a primary target for cyber 
criminals, hostile nation states, opportunists 
and hacktivists. There are high levels of 
sophistication in criminal hacking for the 
purpose of stealing money, stealing, 
destroying or manipulating data (including 
customer data) and/or disrupting operations, 
where multiple threats exist including threats 
arising from malicious emails, distributed 
denial of service (DDoS) attacks, payment 
system compromises, insider attackers, supply 
chain and vulnerability exploitation. Cyber 
events can have a compounding impact on 
services and customers, e.g. data breaches in 
social networking sites, retail companies and 
payments networks. 

The threat of cyberattack is recognised by 
the Group along with the significant potential 
impact on all areas of its business ranging 
from operational matters to its scrutiny of 
its relationships with its suppliers, customers 
and other external stakeholders. Regulators 
in the UK, US and Europe continue to focus 
on cybersecurity risk management in the 
financial sector and have highlighted the 
need for financial institutions to improve their 
monitoring and control of, and resilience 
(particularly of critical services) to, 
cyberattacks and to provide timely notification 
of them, as appropriate. This has resulted 
in a number of proposed laws, regulations 
and other requirements that necessitate 
implementation of a variety of increased 
controls and enhancement activities for 
regulated Group entities. These include, 
among others, the adoption of cybersecurity 
policies and procedures meeting specified 
criteria, minimum required security measures, 
controls and procedures for enhanced 
reporting and public disclosures, compliance 
certification requirements, and other cyber 
and information risk governance measures. 
The Group continues to use an intelligence-
driven defence approach, analysing external 
events for current and emerging cyberthreats 
which allows the delivery of proactive counter 
measures; the Group also completes 
cyberthreat scenarios and incident playbooks 
to assess our security posture and business 
impacts and runs an internal adversarial 
capability which simulates hackers to 
proactively test controls and responses. 
The increased control environment will 
continue to enhance our security posture and 
our ability to better protect the organisation 
and our customers. Cyberattacks however are 
increasingly sophisticated and there can be no 
assurance that the measures implemented 
will be fully effective to prevent or mitigate 
future attacks, the consequences of which 
could be significant to the Group. 
Furthermore, such measures have resulted 
and will result in increased technology and 
other costs in connection with cybersecurity 
mitigation and compliance for the Group.

For further information, refer to the 
operational risk management section 
on pages 143 and 144.

MODEL RISK, CONDUCT RISK, REPUTATION RISK AND LEGAL RISK

Model risk 
Since the inception of model risk as a 
principal risk, key achievements to date 
include creating a complete model inventory 
across the firm, roll out of a robust Model 
Risk Management (MRM) framework and 
the validation of all high material models. In 
2019 the framework and governance of 
model risk was further improved by:

■■ enhancing the Barclays PLC Board 
oversight of model risk, through the 
reporting of the model risk tolerance 
framework and periodic updates to the 
Barclays PLC Board on the progress of 
the MRM implementation

■■ validating a third of the population of low 
material models

■■ strengthening the model inventory 
identification process, including 
enhancing the model life cycle 
technology platform

■■ better alignment of documentation 
requirements to model materiality.

In 2020 MRM will continue to focus on the 
validation of remaining low material models, 
bringing 95% of model risk into governance 
as well as reviewing performance monitoring 
of models already in governance to assess 
their compliance with the framework.

Conduct risk
Barclays is committed to continuing to drive 
the right culture throughout all levels of the 
organisation. The Group will continue to 
enhance effective management of conduct 
risk and appropriately consider the relevant 
tools, governance and management 
information in decision-making processes. 
Focus on management of conduct risk is 
ongoing and amongst other relevant 
business and control management 
information the Trading Entity Conduct 
Dashboards are a key component of this. 

The Group continues to review the role and 
impact of Conduct Risk Events and issues 
in the remuneration process at both the 
individual and business level.

Businesses have continued to assess the 
potential customer, client and market 
impacts of strategic change. As part of the 
2019 Medium-Term Planning Process, 
associated Strategic Risk Assessment and 
Strategic Element of the Business Plan, 
material conduct risks associated with 
strategic and financial plans were assessed. 

Throughout 2019, conduct risks were raised 
by each business area for consideration by 
relevant Board-level committees. The 
committees reviewed the risks raised and 
whether management's proposed actions 
were appropriate to mitigate the risks 
effectively. The Board received regular 
updates with regards to key risks and issues 
including those relating to regulatory change 
and the effectiveness of the control 
environment. 

The Group continued to incur costs in 
relation to litigation and conduct matters, 
refer to Note 26 Legal, competition and 
regulatory matters and Note 24 Provisions, 
for further details. Costs include customer 
redress and remediation, as well as fines and 
settlements. Resolution of these matters 
remains a necessary and important part of 
delivering the Group's strategy and an 
ongoing commitment to improve oversight 
of culture and conduct. 

Barclays has operated at the overall set 
tolerance for conduct risk throughout 2019. 
The tolerance adherence is assessed by the 
business areas through Key Indicators which 
are aggregated and provide an overall rating 
which is reported to relevant Board level 
committees. This is supported by additional 
tools such as the Risk and Control 
Self-Assessment.

For further details on the non-financial 
performance measures, refer to pages 
18 and 19 of the Strategic Report.

Reputation risk
Barclays is committed to identifying 
reputation risks and issues as early as 
possible and managing them appropriately. 
At a Group level throughout 2019, reputation 
risks and issues were overseen by the Board 
Reputation Committee (RepCo) until 
September 2019 and the Board thereafter 
(refer to the Board report on page 44 for 
further detail), which reviews the processes 
and policies by which Barclays identifies and 
manages reputation risk. Within the Barclays 
Bank UK Group and the Barclays Bank Group, 
reputation risks and issues were overseen by 
the respective risk and Board risk committees. 
The top live and emerging reputation risks 
and issues within the Barclays Bank UK Group 
and the Barclays Bank Group are included 
within an over-arching quarterly report at 
the respective Board level.

RepCo and the Board reviewed risks 
escalated by the businesses and considered 
whether management's proposed actions, 
for example attaching conditions to 
proposed client transactions or increased 
engagement with impacted stakeholders, 
were appropriate to mitigate the risks 
effectively. RepCo and the Board also 
received regular updates with regard to key 
reputation risks and issues, including: legacy 
conduct issues; Barclays' association with 
sensitive sectors; cyber and data security; 
consumer and household debt; fraud and 
scams that could impact Barclays customers 
and the resilience of key Barclays systems 
and processes.

The Group continued to incur costs in 
relation to litigation and conduct matters, 
refer to Note 26 Legal, competition and 
regulatory matters and Note 24 Provisions 
for further details. Costs include customer 
redress and remediation, as well as fines and 
settlements. Resolution of these matters 
remains an ongoing commitment to improve 
oversight of culture and conduct and 
management of reputation.

In 2019, Corporate Relations received 
498 referrals from across the businesses 
(486 referrals in 2018) for consideration. 
These referrals covered a variety of 
potentially controversial sectors and topics 
including, but not limited to, environmental 
and social risks.

As part of Barclays 2019 Medium Term 
Planning process, material reputation risks 
associated with strategic and financial plans 
were also assessed.

Legal risk 
The Group remains committed to 
continuous improvements to manage legal 
risk effectively. A number of enhancements 
have been implemented during 2019, 
including updating the Group framework for 
managing legal risk and associated policies 
as well as reviewing legal risk tolerances and 
risk appetite. Updated legal risk mandatory 
training was also implemented across the 
Group, reinforced by ongoing engagement 
and education of the Group's businesses and 
functions.

Throughout 2019, the Group operated within 
set tolerances for legal risk. Tolerance 
adherence is assessed through key 
indicators, which are reviewed through the 
relevant risk and control committees. In 
addition to ongoing monitoring, legal risk 
controls are reviewed and assessed annually 
as part of the Risk and Control Self-
Assessment process.

Reputation risk and 
Legal risk

RISK REVIEW

Supervision of the Barclays Group 
The Barclays Group's operations, including 
its overseas branches, subsidiaries and 
associates, are subject to a large number 
of rules and regulations that are a condition 
for authorisation to conduct banking and 
financial services business in each of the 
jurisdictions in which the Barclays Group 
operates. These apply to business operations, 
impact financial returns and include capital, 
leverage and liquidity requirements, 
authorisation, registration and reporting 
requirements, restrictions on certain activities, 
conduct of business regulations and many 
others. Regulatory developments impact the 
Barclays Group globally. We focus particularly 
on EU, UK and US regulation due to the 
location of the Barclays Group's principal areas 
of business. Regulations elsewhere may also 
have a significant impact on the Barclays 
Group due to the location of its branches, 
subsidiaries and, in some cases, clients. For 
more information on the risks related to the 
supervision and regulation of the Barclays 
Group, including regulatory change, see the 
Risk Factor entitled ‘Regulatory change 
agenda and impact on business model' on 
page 130. 

Supervision in the UK and EU 
The Barclays Group's operations in Europe are 
authorised and regulated by a combination 
of its UK home regulators and host regulators 
in the European countries where the Barclays 
Group operates. The impact of the UK's 
departure from the EU in this respect and, 
more broadly, its impact on the UK domestic 
regulatory framework, is yet to be finally 
determined. In the UK, day-to-day regulation 
and supervision of the Barclays Group is 
divided between the Prudential Regulation 
Authority (PRA) (a division of the Bank of 
England (BoE)) and the Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA). In addition, the Financial 
Policy Committee (FPC) of the BoE has 
influence on the prudential requirements 
that may be imposed on the banking 
system through its powers of direction 
and recommendation. 

Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Bank UK PLC 
are authorised credit institutions and subject 
to prudential supervision by the PRA and 
subject to conduct regulation and supervision 
by the FCA. The Barclays Group is also subject 
to prudential supervision by the PRA on a 
group consolidated basis. Barclays Capital 
Securities Limited is authorised and 

supervised by the PRA as a PRA-designated 
investment firm and subject to conduct 
regulation and supervision by the FCA. 
Barclays Services Limited is an appointed 
representative of Barclays Bank PLC and 
Clydesdale Financial Services Limited. 

Barclays Bank Ireland PLC is licensed as a 
credit institution by the Central Bank of Ireland 
(CBI) and is designated as a significant 
institution falling under direct supervision 
on a solo basis by the European Central Bank 
(ECB). Barclays Bank Ireland PLC's EU 
branches are supervised by the ECB and are 
also subject to direct supervision for local 
conduct purposes by national supervisory 
authorities in the jurisdictions where they 
are established. 

The Barclays Group is also subject to 
regulatory initiatives undertaken by the 
UK Payment Systems Regulator (PSR), 
as a participant in payment systems 
regulated by the PSR.

The PRA's continuing supervision of the 
Barclays Group is conducted through a variety 
of regulatory tools, including the collection 
of information by way of prudential returns 
or cross-firm reviews, reports obtained from 
skilled persons, regular supervisory visits to 
firms and regular meetings with management 
and Directors to discuss issues such as 
strategy, governance, financial resilience, 
operational resilience, risk management, 
and recovery and resolution.

Parliament gave the FCA a single strategic 
objective – to ensure that relevant markets 
function well – and three operational 
objectives: to protect consumers, enhance 
market integrity and promote competition. 
The FCA's supervision of the UK firms in the 
Barclays Group is carried out through a 
combination of proactive engagement, regular 
thematic work and project work based on the 
FCA's sector assessments, which analyse the 
different areas of the market and the risks that 
may lie ahead. 

Both the PRA and the FCA apply standards 
that either anticipate or go beyond 
requirements established by global or EU 
standards, whether in relation to capital, 
leverage and liquidity, resolvability and 
resolution or matters of conduct. 

The FCA has focused on conduct risk and on 
customer outcomes and will continue to do 
so. This has included a focus on the design 
and operation of products, the behaviour of 
customers and the operation of markets. 

The FCA is conducting ongoing work on 
fair pricing in financial services, affordability 
and fair treatment of vulnerable customers. 
These initiatives may impact future revenues 
and increase conduct costs and costs 
of remediation. 

The FCA and the PRA also apply the Senior 
Managers and Certification Regime (the 
SMCR) which imposes a regulatory approval, 
individual accountability and fitness and 
propriety framework in respect of senior 
or key individuals within relevant firms. 

Supervision in the US 
The Barclays Group's US activities and 
operations are subject to umbrella supervision 
by the Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System (FRB), as well as additional 
supervision, requirements and restrictions 
imposed by other federal and state regulators 
and self-regulatory organisations (SROs). 
Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC and its 
US branches and subsidiaries are subject 
to a comprehensive regulatory framework 
involving numerous statutes, rules and 
regulations. In some cases, US requirements 
may impose restrictions on the Barclays 
Group's global activities, in addition to its 
activities in the US. 

Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays 
US LLC (BUSL) are regulated as bank holding 
companies (BHCs) by the FRB. BUSL is the 
Barclays Group's top-tier US holding company 
that holds substantially all of the Barclays 
Group's US subsidiaries (including Barclays 
Capital Inc. and Barclays Bank Delaware). 
BUSL is subject to requirements in respect of 
capital adequacy, capital planning and stress 
testing, risk management and governance, 
liquidity, leverage limits, large exposure limits, 
activities restrictions and financial regulatory 
reporting. Barclays Bank PLC's US branches 
are also subject to enhanced prudential 
supervision requirements relating to, among 
other things, liquidity and risk management. 

Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC and BUSL 
have elected to be treated as financial holding 
companies (FHCs) under the Bank Holding 
Company Act of 1956. FHC status allows 
these entities to engage in a variety of 
financial and related activities, directly or 
through subsidiaries, including underwriting, 
dealing and market making in securities. 
Failure to maintain FHC status could result in 
increasingly stringent penalties and, 
ultimately, in the closure or cessation of 
certain operations in the US.

In addition to umbrella oversight by the FRB, 
many of the Barclays Group's branches and 
subsidiaries are regulated by additional 
authorities based on the location or activities 
of those entities. The New York and Florida 
branches of Barclays Bank PLC are subject 
to supervision and regulation by, respectively, 
the New York State Department of Financial 
Services (NYSDFS) and the Florida Office of 
Financial Regulation, as well as the applicable 
Federal Reserve Banks. Barclays Bank 
Delaware, a Delaware chartered commercial 
bank, is subject to supervision and regulation 
by the Delaware Office of the State Bank 
Commissioner, the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation (FDIC), and the Consumer 
Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The 
deposits of Barclays Bank Delaware are 
insured by the FDIC and Barclays PLC, Barclays 
Bank PLC and BUSL are required to act as a 
source of strength for Barclays Bank Delaware. 
This could, among other things, require these 
entities to inject capital into Barclays Bank 
Delaware if it fails to meet applicable 
regulatory capital requirements. Barclays Bank 
Delaware is subject to direct supervision 
and regulation by the CFPB, which has the 
authority to examine and take enforcement 
action related to compliance with US federal 
consumer financial laws and regulations.

The Barclays Group's US securities broker/
dealer and investment banking operations, 
primarily conducted through Barclays Capital 
Inc., are also subject to ongoing supervision 
and regulation by the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC), the Financial Industry 
Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and other 
government agencies and SROs under US 
federal and state securities laws. 

The Barclays Group's US commodity futures, 
commodity options and swaps-related and 
client clearing operations are subject to 
ongoing supervision and regulation by the 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission 
(CFTC), the National Futures Association and 
other SROs. Barclays Bank PLC is also a US 
registered swap dealer and is subject to the 
FRB swaps rules with respect to margin and 
capital requirements. 

Supervision in Asia Pacific 
The Barclays Group's operations in Asia Pacific 
are supervised and regulated by a broad range 
of national banking and financial services 
regulators. 

Brexit
There remains much uncertainty regarding 
the state of the future relationship between 
the UK and the EU and therefore the potential 
impact of the UK's withdrawal from the EU on 
the financial regulatory framework in the UK. 
Following the UK's withdrawal from the EU on 
31 January 2020, pursuant to the withdrawal 
agreement negotiated between the UK and 
the EU in October 2019, firms incorporated 
and authorised in the UK are able to continue 
to provide services into the EU27, and firms 
incorporated and authorised in the EU27 are 
able to continue to provide services into the 
UK in accordance with the terms of the 
withdrawal agreement for the duration of the 
transition period set out in the agreement. 
Following the expiry of that transitional period 
in December 2020, the ability of UK firms to 
access the EU market and vice versa would 
depend upon the terms of any future trade 
deal between the UK and the EU, including 
whether such deal provides for any access 
rights in respect of financial services. It would 
also depend upon whether the EU grants 
equivalence to the UK as a third country 
pursuant to equivalence regimes in existing 
EU financial services legislation. If, after the 
expiry of the transitional period in December 
2020, there is no deal or arrangement 
covering financial services in place and 
assuming no third country “equivalence”-
based recognition in place, the Barclays Group 
entities in the UK would no longer be able to 
access EU markets as they do today. As a 
result of the onshoring of EU legislation in the 
UK, UK firms would (at least initially) be 
subject to substantially the same rules and 
regulations as before Brexit. The UK may seek 
to make changes to these rules going forward, 
particularly in the event of no deal or 
arrangement covering financial services, 
where they are not subject to any 
requirements to maintain particular rules or 
standards for equivalence purposes. 

Financial regulatory framework 
(a) Prudential regulation 
Certain Basel III standards were implemented 
in EU law through the Capital Requirements 
Regulation (CRR) and the Capital 
Requirements Directive IV (CRD IV). Beyond 
the minimum standards required by CRD IV, 
the PRA has expected the Barclays Group, 
in common with other major UK banks and 
building societies, to meet a 7% Common 
Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio at the level of the 
consolidated group since 1 January 2016. 

Global systemically important banks (G-SIBs), 
such as the Barclays Group, are subject to a 
number of additional prudential requirements, 
including the requirement to hold additional 
loss-absorbing capacity and additional capital 
buffers above the level required by Basel III 
standards. The level of the G-SIB buffer is set 
by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) 
according to a bank's systemic importance 
and can range from 1% to 3.5% of risk-
weighted assets (RWAs). The G-SIB buffer 
must be met with CET1. In November 2019, 
the FSB published an update to its list of 
G-SIBs, maintaining the 1.5% G-SIB buffer 
that applies to the Barclays Group. 

The Barclays Group is also subject to a 
‘combined buffer requirement' consisting 
of (i) a capital conservation buffer, and 
(ii) a countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB). 
The CCyB is based on rates determined by 
the regulatory authorities in each jurisdiction 
in which the Barclays Group maintains 
exposures. These rates may vary in either 
direction. In December 2019, the FPC raised 
the UK CCyB rate from 1% to 2% with binding 
effect from December 2020. 

The PRA requires UK firms to hold additional 
capital to cover risks which the PRA assesses 
are not fully captured by the Pillar 1 capital 
requirement. The PRA sets this additional 
capital requirement (Pillar 2A) at least 
annually, derived from each firm's individual 
capital guidance. Under current PRA rules, the 
Pillar 2A must be met with at least 56% CET1 
capital and no more than 25% Tier 2 capital.  
In addition, the capital that firms use to meet 
their minimum requirements (Pillar 1 and 
Pillar 2A) cannot be counted towards meeting 
the combined buffer requirement.

RISK REVIEW

 Supervision and regulation

The PRA may also impose a ‘PRA buffer' to 
cover risks over a forward-looking planning 
horizon, including with regard to firm-specific 
stresses or management and governance 
weaknesses. If the PRA buffer is imposed on a 
specific firm, it must be met separately to the 
combined buffer requirement, and must be 
met fully with CET1 capital.

The systemic risk buffer (which can be set 
between 0% and 3% of RWAs) is a firm-
specific buffer, that is designed to increase 
the capacity of ring-fenced bodies, such as 
Barclays Bank UK PLC, to absorb stress, and 
which must be met solely with CET1 capital. 
The buffer rate applicable to the Barclays 
Group's ring-fenced sub-group is 1% of RWAs. 
The systemic risk buffer is now incorporated 
in the calculation of banks' stress test hurdle 
rates, which are the target capital ratios set 
by the PRA, with a view to capturing domestic 
as well as global systemic importance. 

Final BCBS standards on counterparty credit 
risk, leverage, large exposures and a Net 
Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) are being 
implemented under EU law via the Risk 
Reduction Measures package, which was 
published in the Official Journal in June 2019 
and includes the CRR II regulation, the CRD V 
directive and the BRRD II directive. 

The BCBS's finalisation of ‘Basel III – post-
crisis regulatory reforms' in December 2017, 
among other things, eliminated model-based 
approaches for certain categories of RWAs, 
revised the standardised approach's risk 
weights for a variety of exposure categories, 
replaced the four current approaches for 
operational risk (including the advanced 
measurement approach) with a single 
standardised measurement approach, 
established 72.5% of standardised approach 
RWAs for exposure categories as a floor for 
RWAs calculated under advanced approaches 
(referred to as the ‘output floor'), and for 
G-SIBs introduced a leverage ratio buffer in an 
amount equal to 50% of the applicable G-SIB 
buffer used for RWA purposes (meaning, 
for the Barclays Group, a leverage ratio buffer 
of 0.75%). The majority of the final Basel III 
changes are due to be implemented 
commencing 1 January 2022, with a five-year 
phase-in period for the output floor, although 
the precise timing as it applies to the Barclays 
Group depends on national and EU legislative 
processes. The new market risk framework, 
including rules made as a result of the 
‘fundamental review of the trading book', 
is expected to be implemented in the UK first 
as a reporting requirement, with further 
legislation needed to replace the existing, 
binding market risk requirements. 

In the US, in October 2019, the FRB and other 
US regulatory agencies released final rules 
to tailor the applicability of prudential 
requirements for large domestic US banking 
organisations, foreign banking organisations 
and their intermediate holding companies 
(IHCs), including BUSL. In the final rule, BUSL 
is a “Category III” IHC. BUSL is therefore 
subject to full standardised liquidity 
requirements, including the liquidity coverage 
ratio, which has been implemented by the US 
regulatory agencies, and the NSFR, which has 
been proposed by the US regulatory agencies 
but does not have a clear time frame 
for finalisation.

In June 2018 and October 2019, the FRB 
finalised rules regarding single counterparty 
credit limits (SCCL). The SCCL apply to the 
largest US BHCs and foreign banks' (including 
the Barclays Group's) US operations. The SCCL 
creates two separate limits for foreign banks, 
the first on combined US operations (CUSO) 
and the second on the US IHC (BUSL). The 
SCCL for US BHCs, including BUSL, will go into 
effect in 2020 and requires that exposure to an 
unaffiliated counterparty of BUSL not exceed 
25% of BUSL's Tier 1 capital. With respect to 
the CUSO, the SCCL rule allows certification to 
the FRB that a foreign bank complies with 
comparable home country regulation.

In November 2019, the FRB issued a proposal 
to extend by 18 months the initial compliance 
date for foreign banks' CUSO to allow the 
home countries of foreign banks time to 
finalize comparable home country regulation. 
Under the proposal, Barclays Bank PLC would 
not need to comply with the CUSO 
requirement until 1 July 2021. In order to give 
the FRB time to finalize the November 
proposal, in December 2019 the FRB 
separately granted Barclays Bank PLC relief 
from the SCCL CUSO requirement through a 
letter indicating that Barclays Bank PLC is not 
required to provide the CUSO certification 
until 1 July 2020.

Stress testing 
The Barclays Group and certain of its 
members are subject to supervisory stress 
testing exercises in a number of jurisdictions, 
designed to assess the resilience of banks to 
adverse economic or financial developments 
and ensure that they have robust, forward-
looking capital planning processes that 
account for the risks associated with their 
business profile. Assessment by regulators 
is on both a quantitative and qualitative basis, 
the latter focusing on such elements as data 
provision, stress testing capability including 
model risk management and internal 
management processes and controls.

(b) Recovery and Resolution 
Stabilisation and resolution framework 
The 2014 Bank Recovery and Resolution 
Directive (BRRD) established a framework 
for the recovery and resolution of EU credit 
institutions and investment firms. 
Amendments to BRRD (referred to as BRRD II) 
were made via the finalisation of the EU Risk 
Reduction Measures. Member states are 
required to transpose BRRD II into national 
law by 28 December 2020 (subject to 
certain exceptions). 

On 28 December 2017, a related EU directive 
came into force harmonising the priority 
ranking of unsecured debt instruments under 
national insolvency laws. The directive has 
been transposed into national law in the UK, 
dividing a financial institution's non-preferred 
debts into three classes in a descending 
ranking order (ordinary, secondary and 
tertiary non-preferential debts). 

UK resolution authorities are empowered by 
law to intervene in and resolve a UK financial 
institution that is failing or likely to fail. The 
BoE (in consultation with the PRA and HM 
Treasury as appropriate) has several 
stabilisation options where a banking 
institution is failing or likely to fail, including, 
for example, to transfer some or all of the 
securities or business of the bank to a 
commercial purchaser or a ‘bridge bank' 
owned by the BoE or to transfer the banking 
institution into temporary public ownership. 
When exercising any of its stabilisation 
powers, the BoE must generally provide that 
shareholders bear first losses, followed by 
creditors in accordance with the priority of 
their claims in insolvency. 

In order to enable the exercise of its 
stabilisation powers, the BoE may impose a 
temporary stay on the rights of creditors to 
terminate, accelerate or close out contracts, 
or override events of default or termination 
rights that might otherwise be invoked as 
a result of a resolution action and modify 
contractual arrangements in certain 
circumstances (including a variation of the 
terms of any securities). In addition, the BoE 
has the power to override, vary, or impose 
conditions or contractual obligations between 
a UK bank, its holding company and its group 
undertakings, in order to enable any transferee 
or successor bank to operate effectively after 
any of the resolution tools have been applied. 
HM Treasury may also amend the law for the 
purpose of enabling it to use its powers under 
this regime effectively, potentially with 
retrospective effect. These powers apply 
regardless of any contractual restrictions 
and compensation that may be payable.

In addition, the BoE is required by law to 
permanently write-down, or convert into 
equity, Tier 1 capital instruments and Tier 2 
capital instruments at the point of non-
viability of the bank. This power will be 
extended to include eligible liabilities 
(such as liabilities under MREL instruments 
(see TLAC and MREL below)) once BRRD II 
is implemented. 

The BoE's preferred approach for the 
resolution of the Barclays Group is a bail-in 
strategy with a single point of entry at 
Barclays PLC. Under such a strategy, Barclays 
PLC's subsidiaries would remain operational 
while Barclays PLC's eligible liabilities would 
be written down or converted to equity in 
order to recapitalise the Barclays Group and 
allow for the continued provision of services 
and operations throughout the resolution. 
The order in which the bail-in tool is applied 
reflects the hierarchy of capital instruments. 
Accordingly, the more subordinated the claim, 
the more likely losses will be suffered.

The PRA has made rules that require 
authorised firms to draw up recovery plans 
and resolution packs, as required by the BRRD. 
Recovery plans are designed to outline credible 
actions that authorised firms could implement 
in the event of severe stress in order to restore 
their business to a stable and sustainable 
condition. Removal of potential impediments 
to an orderly resolution of a banking group or 
one or more of its subsidiaries is considered 
as part of the BoE's and PRA's supervisory 
strategy for each firm, and the PRA can 
require firms to make significant changes in 
order to enhance resolvability. The Barclays 
Group currently provides the PRA with a 
recovery plan annually and with a resolution 
pack as requested. 

In July 2019, the BoE and PRA published final 
policies on the Resolvability Assessment 
Framework (RAF), designed to increase 
transparency and accountability and clarify 
the responsibilities on firms with respect 
to resolution. The RAF consists of three 
components: (i) how the BoE will assess 
resolvability; (ii) the requirement for certain 
firms to perform an assessment of their 
preparations for resolution, submit a report to 
the PRA and publish a summary of their most 
recent report; and (iii) the BoE's publication of 
a statement concerning the resolvability of 
each in-scope firm. The BoE will assess firms 
against three resolvability outcomes they must 
meet by 2022: (i) adequate financial resources; 
(ii) being able to continue to do business 
through resolution and restructuring; and (iii) 
being able to communicate and co-ordinate 
within the firm and with authorities. 

While regulators in many jurisdictions have 
indicated a preference for single point of entry 
resolution for the Barclays Group, additional 
resolution or bankruptcy provisions may apply 
to certain Barclays Group entities or branches. 

In the US, BUSL is subject to the Orderly 
Liquidation Authority established by Title II of 
the Dodd-Frank Act, a regime for the orderly 
liquidation of systemically important financial 
institutions by the FDIC, as an alternative to 
proceedings under the US Bankruptcy Code. 
In addition, the licensing authorities of each 
US branch of Barclays Bank PLC and of 
Barclays Bank Delaware have the authority to 
take possession of the business and property 
of the applicable branch or entity they license 
and/or to revoke or suspend such licence. 

In the US, Title I of the DFA, as amended, and 
the implementing regulations issued by the 
FRB and the FDIC require each bank holding 
company with assets of $250bn or more, 
including those within the Barclays Group, 
to prepare and submit a plan for the orderly 
resolution of subsidiaries and operations in 
the event of future material financial distress 
or failure. The Barclays Group's next 
submission of the US Resolution Plan in 
respect of its US operations will be due on 
1 July 2020. 

Barclays Bank Ireland PLC, as a significant 
institution under the Single Resolution 
Mechanism Regulation (SRMR), is subject 
to the powers of the Single Resolution Board 
(SRB) as the Eurozone resolution authority. 
The CBI and the ECB require Barclays Bank 
Ireland PLC to submit a standalone BRRD-
compliant recovery plan on an annual basis. 
The SRB has the power to require data 
submissions specific to Barclays Bank Ireland 
PLC under powers conferred upon it by the 
BRRD and the SRMR. The SRB will exercise 
these powers to determine the optimal 
resolution strategy for Barclays Bank Ireland 
PLC in the context of the BoE's preferred 
resolution strategy of single point of entry 
with bail-in at Barclays PLC. The SRB also has 
the power under the BRRD and the SRMR to 
develop a resolution plan for Barclays Bank 
Ireland PLC.

TLAC and MREL 
The BRRD requires competent authorities 
to impose a Minimum Requirement for own 
funds and Eligible Liabilities (MREL) on 
financial institutions to facilitate their orderly 
resolution without broader financial disruption 
or recourse to public funds. In November 
2015, the FSB finalised its proposals to 
enhance the loss-absorbing capacity of G-SIBs 
and set a new minimum requirement for ‘total 
loss-absorbing capacity' (TLAC). The FSB also 
published guiding principles on internal TLAC 
in July 2017. 

The EU is implementing the TLAC standard 
(including internal TLAC) via the MREL 
requirement for G-SIBs and the relevant 
amendments are contained in the Risk 
Reduction Measures package. Under the BoE's 
2018 statement of policy on MREL, the BoE 
will set MREL for UK G-SIBs as necessary to 
implement the TLAC standard and institution 
or group-specific MREL requirements will 
depend on the preferred resolution strategy 
for that institution or group. Internal MREL 
for operating subsidiaries will be scaled within 
a 75-90% range of the external requirement 
that would apply to the subsidiary if it were 
a resolution entity. The starting point for the 
scalar will be 90% for ring-fenced bank 
sub-groups.

The MREL requirements are being phased in 
as from 1 January 2019. From 1 January 2020, 
G-SIBs with resolution entities incorporated in 
the UK, including the Barclays Group, will be 
subject to an MREL requirement equivalent 
to the higher of: (i) the sum of two times the 
Pillar 1 requirement and one times the Pillar 
2A requirement; or (ii) the higher of two 
times the leverage ratio or 6% of leverage 
exposures. The MREL requirements will be 
fully implemented by 1 January 2022, at which 
time such G-SIBs will be required to meet an 
MREL equivalent to the higher of: (i) two times 
the sum of their Pillar 1 and Pillar 2A 
requirements; or (ii) the higher of two times 
their leverage ratio or 6.75% of leverage 
exposures.

RISK REVIEW

 Supervision and regulation

Barclays Bank Ireland PLC is subject to the 
SRB's MREL policy, as issued in January 2019, 
in respect of the internal MREL that it will be 
required to issue to Barclays Bank Group. 
The SRB's MREL policy will be revised in the 
near future to reflect the implementation of 
the Risk Reduction Measures package in the 
EU. The SRB's current calibration of MREL is 
two times the sum of: (i) the firm's Pillar 1 
requirement; (ii) its Pillar 2 requirement; and 
(iii) its combined buffer requirement, minus 
125 basis points. The SRB's policy does not 
envisage the application of any scalar in 
respect of the internal MREL requirement. 

In the US, the FRB's TLAC rule includes 
provisions that require BUSL to have: 
(i) a specified outstanding amount of eligible 
long-term debt; (ii) a specified outstanding 
amount of TLAC (consisting of common and 
preferred equity regulatory capital plus eligible 
long-term debt); and (iii) a specified common 
equity buffer. In addition, the FRB's TLAC rule 
prohibits BUSL, for so long as the Barclays 
Group's overall resolution plan treats BUSL 
as a non-resolution entity, from issuing TLAC 
to entities other than those within the 
Barclays Group. 

Bank Levy and FSCS
The BRRD requires EU member states to 
establish a pre-funded resolution financing 
arrangement with funding equal to 1% of 
covered deposits by 31 December 2024 to 
cover the costs of bank resolutions. The UK 
has implemented this requirement by way of 
a tax on the balance sheets of banks known 
as the ‘Bank Levy'.

In addition, the UK has a statutory 
compensation fund called the Financial 
Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS), 
which is funded by way of annual levies 
on most financial services firms authorised 
under FSMA. 

(c) Structural reform 
In the UK, the Financial Services (Banking 
Reform) Act 2013 put in place a framework for 
ring-fencing certain operations of large banks 
and secondary legislation passed in 2014 
elaborated on the operation and application of 
the ring-fence. Ring-fencing requires, among 
other things, the separation of the retail and 
smaller deposit-taking business activities of 
UK banks into a legally distinct, operationally 
separate and economically independent entity, 
which is not permitted to undertake a range 
of activities. 

US regulation places further substantive limits 
on the activities that may be conducted by 
banks and holding companies, including 
foreign banking organisations such as the 
Barclays Group. The ‘Volcker Rule', which was 
part of the DFA and which came into effect 
in the US in 2015, prohibits banking entities 
from undertaking certain proprietary trading 
activities and limits such entities' ability to 
sponsor or invest in certain private equity 
funds and hedge funds (in each case broadly 
defined). As required by the rule, the Barclays 
Group has developed and implemented 
an extensive compliance and monitoring 
programme addressing proprietary trading 
and covered fund activities (both inside and 
outside of the US). In August 2019 the Volcker 
regulatory agencies finalised amendments 
to the Volcker Rule's proprietary trading 
provisions, which became effective on 
1 January 2020 (with a mandatory compliance 
date of 1 January 2021). The amendments 
generally provide greater flexibility for banking 
entities, and in particular for business units 
that operate solely outside the US. The Volcker 
Rule agencies have indicated that further 
changes are likely to be proposed in 2020 
with regard to the Volcker covered funds 
provisions.

(d) Market infrastructure regulation 
In recent years, regulators as well as 
global-standard setting bodies such as the 
International Organisation of Securities 
Commissions (IOSCO) have focused on 
improving transparency and reducing risk in 
markets, particularly risks related to over-the-
counter (OTC) transactions. This focus has 
resulted in a variety of new regulations across 
the G20 countries and beyond that require or 
encourage on-venue trading, clearing, posting 
of margin and disclosure of pre-trade and 
post-trade information. Some of the most 
significant developments are described below. 

The European Market Infrastructure 
Regulation, as amended, (EMIR) has 
introduced requirements designed to improve 
transparency and reduce the risks associated 
with the derivatives market, some of which 
are still to be fully implemented. EMIR has 
potential operational and financial impacts 
on the Barclays Group, including by imposing 
new collateral requirements. Over the coming 
months, European regulators will undergo 
a review of the exchange of collateral rules, 
raising the possibility of some alterations to 
the existing rules. European regulators are 
also currently consulting on details of the 
recent amendments to EMIR, which could 
potentially have a significant impact on our 
clearing business.

CRD IV complements EMIR by applying higher 
capital requirements for bilateral, uncleared 
OTC derivative trades. Lower capital 
requirements for cleared derivative trades 
are only available if the central counterparty 
(CCP) through which the trade is cleared 
is recognised as a ‘qualifying central 
counterparty' (QCCP) which has been 
authorised or recognised under EMIR. 

The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive 
and Markets in Financial Instruments 
Regulation (collectively referred to as MiFID II) 
have largely been applicable since 3 January 
2018. MiFID II affects many of the investment 
markets in which the Barclays Group operates, 
the instruments in which it trades and the 
way it transacts with market counterparties 
and other customers. MiFID II is currently 
undergoing a review process in order to 
determine those areas of the regulation 
that require further amendment. These 
amendments are being considered 
particularly in light of the EU's ongoing focus 
on the development of a stronger Capital 
Markets Union. 

As part of the EU's sustainable finance action 
plan, new regulatory requirements are being 
introduced to provide greater transparency 
on the environmental and social impact 
of financial investments. These include 
(i) the Regulation on Sustainability-Related 
Disclosures, which introduces disclosure 
obligations regarding the way in which 
financial institutions integrate environmental, 
social and governance factors in their 
investment decisions, and (ii) the Taxonomy 
Regulation, which provides for a general 
framework for the development of an EU-wide 
classification system for environmentally 
sustainable economic activities. These new 
requirements will have an impact on the 
Barclays Group as an intermediary 
performing investment services for customers 
and investors. 

The EU Benchmarks Regulation applies to the 
administration, contribution and use of 
benchmarks within the EU. Financial 
institutions within the EU are prohibited from 
using benchmarks unless their administrators 
are authorised, registered or otherwise 
recognised in the EU, subject to transitional 
provisions expiring on 1 January 2022. The 
FCA has stated that it does not intend to 
support LIBOR after the end of 2021. 
International initiatives are therefore underway 
to develop alternative benchmarks and 
backstop arrangements.

US regulators have imposed similar rules 
as the EU with respect to the mandatory 
on-venue trading and clearing of certain 
derivatives, and post-trade transparency, 
as well as in relation to the margining of 
OTC derivatives. 

US regulators are continuing to review and 
consider their rules with respect to their 
application on a cross-border basis, including 
with respect to their registration requirements 
in relation to non-US swap dealers and 
security-based swap dealers. The regulators 
may adopt further rules, or provide further 
guidance, regarding cross-border applicability. 
In December 2017, the CFTC and the European 
Commission recognised the trading venues 
of each other's jurisdiction to allow market 
participants to comply with mandatory 
on-venue trading requirements while trading 
on certain venues recognised by the other 
jurisdiction. In April 2019, the CFTC issued 
temporary relief that would permit trading 
venues and market participants located in 
the UK to continue to rely on this mutual 
recognition framework following a withdrawal 
of the UK from the EU.

Certain participants in US swap markets are 
required to register with the CFTC as ‘swap 
dealers' or ‘major swap participants' and/or, 
following the compliance date for relevant 
SEC rules, with the SEC as ‘security-based 
swap dealers' or ‘major security-based swap 
participants'. Such registrants are subject to 
CFTC, and will be subject to SEC, regulation 
and oversight. Entities required to register as 
swap dealers are subject to business conduct, 
record keeping and reporting requirements 
under CFTC rules. Barclays Bank PLC is subject 
to regulation by the FRB, and has provisionally 
registered with the CFTC as a swap dealer. 
Accordingly, Barclays Bank PLC is subject to 
CFTC rules on business conduct, record-
keeping and reporting and to FRB rules on 
capital and margin. 

The CFTC has approved certain comparability 
determinations that permit substituted 
compliance with non-US regulatory regimes 
for certain swap regulations. Substituted 
compliance is permitted for certain 
transaction-level requirements, where 
applicable, only with respect to transactions 
between a non-US swap dealer and a non-US 
counterparty, whereas entity-level 
determinations generally apply on an 
entity-wide basis regardless of counterparty 
status. In April 2019, the CFTC issued 
temporary relief that would permit swap 
dealers located in the UK to continue to rely 
on existing CFTC substituted compliance 
determinations with respect to EU 

requirements in the event of a withdrawal of 
the UK from the EU. In addition, the CFTC has 
issued guidance that would require a non-US 
swap dealer to comply with certain CFTC 
rules in connection with transactions that 
are “arranged, negotiated or executed” from 
the US. The CFTC has provided temporary 
no-action relief from application of the 
guidance. In December 2019 the CFTC 
proposed rules that would, for certain CFTC 
requirements, codify on a permanent basis, 
the temporary no-action relief for transactions 
that are arranged, negotiated or executed in 
the US. The proposed rules would also codify 
certain aspects of the CFTC's current 
cross-border framework with respect to 
internal and external business conduct 
requirements, and it is expected that the CFTC 
will introduce additional proposed rules 
addressing mandatory clearing, trading and 
reporting requirements. In October 2017, the 
CFTC issued an order permitting substituted 
compliance with EU margin rules for certain 
uncleared derivatives. However, as the 
Barclays Group is subject to the margin rules 
of the FRB, it will not benefit from the CFTC's 
action unless the FRB takes a similar 
approach. 

The SEC finalised the rules governing security 
based swap dealer registration in 2015 but 
clarified that registration timing is contingent 
upon the finalisation of certain additional rules 
under Title VII of DFA. In December of 2019 
the SEC adopted a final cross-border rule that, 
upon publication in the federal register, will 
trigger the timeline for security-based swap 
dealer registration, which will be required 18 
months following the effective date of those 
rules, currently expected in September 2021.

When security-based swap dealer registration 
is required, it is anticipated that Barclays Bank 
PLC and/or one or more of its affiliates will be 
required to register in that capacity and thus 
will be required to comply with the SEC's rules 
for security-based swap dealers. These rules 
may impose costs and other requirements or 
restrictions that could impact our business. 
As with similar CFTC rules, substituted 
compliance will be available for certain 
security-based swap dealer requirements; 
however, the SEC has not yet issued any 
comparability determinations, and the 
ultimate scope and applicability of such 
determinations remains unclear.

(e) Conduct, culture 
and other regulation 
Conduct and culture 
The PRA and FCA measures to increase the 
individual accountability of senior managers 
and other covered individuals in the banking 
sector include: the ‘Senior Managers Regime', 
which applies to a limited number of 
individuals with senior management 
responsibilities within a firm; the ‘Certification 
Regime', which is intended to assess and 
monitor the fitness and propriety of a wider 
range of employees who could pose a risk of 
significant harm to the firm or its customers; 
and conduct rules that individuals subject to 
either regime must comply with. From March 
2017, the conduct rules have applied more 
widely to other staff of firms within the scope 
of the regime, including the Barclays Group. 

Our regulators have also enhanced their focus 
on the promotion of cultural values as a key 
area for banks, although they generally view 
the responsibility for reforming culture as 
primarily sitting with the industry. 

Data protection and PSD2 
Most countries in which the Barclays Group 
operates have comprehensive laws governing 
the collection and use of personal information. 
Prominent media reporting of recent 
cybersecurity breaches or data losses and 
the significant penalties being handed down 
by European privacy regulators have 
heightened interest in data privacy worldwide. 
The introduction of the EU's General Data 
Protection Regulation (GDPR) does not 
significantly alter the core principles 
established under the earlier Data Protection 
Directive, but it creates a harmonised privacy 
regime across European member states with 
penalties up to the higher of 4% of global 
turnover or €20m. The GDPR also institutes 
new mandatory breach notification 
requirements, enhances the rights of 
individual data subjects and introduces an 
accountability principle concerned with 
openly demonstrating compliance. The 
international nature of our business and IT 
infrastructure means personal information 
may be available in countries other than from 
where it originated. The GDPR has extra-
territorial effect where a business established 
outside the EU is processing personal data 
of individuals located in the EU (e.g. European 
based customers or clients) and such 
processing relates to the offering of goods 
or services to such individuals, or the 
monitoring of their behaviour in the EU.

RISK REVIEW

 Supervision and regulation

In the United States, the California Consumer 
Privacy Protection Act (CCPA), effective 
1 January 2020, requires companies that 
process information regarding California 
residents to make new disclosures to 
consumers about their data collection, 
use and sharing practices, allows consumers 
to opt out of certain data sharing with third 
parties and provides a new cause of action 
for data breaches. It remains unclear what 
modifications will be made, if any, to the CCPA 
and its regulations and how these will be 
interpreted. The introduction of the CCPA has 
prompted several other US states to consider 
similar legislation. Elsewhere non-EU 
countries such as Bermuda, Brazil, India, 
Cayman Islands, China, Guernsey, Jersey, Isle 
of Man, and Switzerland have introduced or 
updated existing legislation, or are considering 
new laws, with provisions that are either 
inspired by the GDPR or that otherwise 
provide enhanced rights to data subjects. 

The revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) 
introduces additional security requirements 
when customers and clients are accessing 
accounts or making payments online. 
In August 2019, the FCA agreed an 18-month 
plan for firms to implement these 
requirements, referred to as Strong Customer 
Authentication (SCA). 

Cybersecurity and operational resilience 
Regulators in Europe and the US continue 
to focus on cybersecurity risk management 
and organisational operational resilience and 
overall soundness across all financial services 
firms, with customer and market expectations 
of continuous access to financial services 
at an all-time high. This has a led to a number 
of proposed laws and changes to regulatory 
frameworks being published, such as the UK 
regulators' proposals for a new operational 
resilience regime, that necessitate the 
implementation of a variety of increased 
controls and enhancement activities for 
regulated Barclays Group entities. To comply 
with these new requirements, firms such as 
the Barclays Group have adopted or will adopt 
a variety of increased controls and processes, 
including, among others, the amendment of 
cybersecurity policies and procedures to 
include specified criteria, additional security 
measures for enhanced reporting and public 
disclosures, compliance certification 
requirements, operational resilience and more 
advanced recovery solutions, as well as other 
cyber and information risk governance 

measures. These increased controls will 
enhance industry standardisation, expand and 
enhance our resilience capabilities as well as 
increase our ability to protect and maintain 
customer service during potential disruptions. 
Such measures are likely to result in increased 
technology and compliance costs for the 
Barclays Group.

Sanctions and financial crime 
The UK Bribery Act 2010 introduced a new 
form of corporate criminal liability focused 
broadly on a company's failure to prevent 
bribery on its behalf. The Criminal Finances 
Act 2017 introduced new corporate criminal 
offences of failing to prevent the facilitation 
of UK and overseas tax evasion. Both pieces 
of legislation have broad application and 
in certain circumstances may have extra-
territorial impact on entities, persons or 
activities located outside the UK, including 
Barclays PLC and its subsidiaries. The UK 
Bribery Act requires the Barclays Group to 
have adequate procedures to prevent bribery 
which, due to the extra-territorial nature of 
the Act, makes this both complex and costly. 
Additionally, the Criminal Finances Act 
requires the Barclays Group to have 
reasonable prevention procedures in place 
to prevent the criminal facilitation of tax 
evasion by persons acting for, or on behalf of, 
the Barclays Group. 

In May 2018, the Sanctions and Anti-Money 
Laundering Act became law in the UK. The Act 
allows for the adoption of an autonomous UK 
Sanctions regime, as well as a more flexible 
licensing regime post-Brexit. 

In July 2018, the 5th EU Anti-Money 
Laundering Directive entered into force. 
Amongst other things, the Directive 
introduces changes to the Enhanced Due 
Diligence measures that are required in 
respect of customer relationships or 
transactions involving high risk non-EU 
countries. EU Member States are required to 
implement the requirements of the Directive 
by January 2020. The UK Government has 
confirmed that it will implement the 
requirements of the Directive, regardless 
of the outcome of Brexit, and on 10 January 
2020 changes to the UK Money Laundering 
Regulations came into force. 

In the US, the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA 
PATRIOT Act 2001 and regulations thereunder 
contain numerous anti-money laundering 
and anti-terrorist financing requirements for 
financial institutions. In addition, the Barclays 
Group is subject to the US Foreign Corrupt 
Practices Act, which prohibits certain 
payments to foreign officials, as well as 
rules and regulations relating to economic 
sanctions and embargo programmes 
administered by the US government, including 
the US Office of Foreign Assets Control and 
the US Department of State, which restrict 
certain business activities with certain 
individuals, entities, groups, countries 
and territories.

In some cases, US state and federal 
regulations addressing sanctions, money 
laundering and other financial crimes may 
impact entities, persons or activities located 
outside the US, including Barclays PLC and 
its subsidiaries. The enforcement of these 
regulations has been a major focus of US 
state and federal government policy relating 
to financial institutions in recent years, 
and failure of a financial institution to ensure 
compliance could have serious legal, financial 
and reputational consequences for 
the institution.

FINANCIAL REVIEW

Key performance indicators

Non-IFRS performance measures
The Group's management believes that the 
non-IFRS performance measures included in 
this document provide valuable information to 
the readers of the financial statements as they 
enable the reader to identify a more consistent 
basis for comparing the businesses' 
performance between financial periods, and 
provide more detail concerning the elements 
of performance which the managers of these 
businesses are most directly able to influence 
or are relevant for an assessment of the 

Group. They also reflect an important aspect 
of the way in which operating targets are 
defined and performance is monitored by 
management. However, any non-IFRS 
performance measures in this document are 
not a substitute for IFRS measures and readers 
should consider the IFRS measures as well. 
Refer to pages 226 to 230 for further 
information and calculations of non-IFRS 
performance measures included throughout 
this section, and the most directly comparable 
IFRS measures.

In assessing the financial 
performance of the Group, 
management uses a range of KPIs 
which focus on the Group's financial 
strength, the delivery of sustainable 
returns and cost management. 
Barclays continues to target greater 
than 10% RoTE, excluding litigation 
and conduct. However, given global 
macroeconomic uncertainty and the 
current low interest rate environment, 
it has become more challenging to 
achieve this in 2020. Notwithstanding 
these headwinds, the Group believes 
it can achieve a meaningful 
improvement in returns in 2020. 
Cost control remains a priority and 
management continues to target a 
cost: income ratio of lower than 60% 
over time.

Definition Why is it important and how the Group performed

Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio
Capital requirements are part of the regulatory 
framework governing how banks and 
depository institutions are supervised. Capital 
ratios express a bank's capital as a percentage 
of its RWAs as defined by the PRA.

CET1 ratio is a measure of capital that is 
predominantly common equity defined by the 
CRR, as amended by the CRR II applicable as 
at the reporting date.

The Group's capital management objective is to 
maximise shareholder value by prudently 
managing the level and mix of its capital to: ensure 
the Group and all of its subsidiaries are 
appropriately capitalised relative to their regulatory 
minimum and stressed capital requirements, 
support the Group's risk appetite, growth and 
strategic options, while seeking to maintain a 
robust credit proposition for the Group and its 
subsidiaries.

The CET1 ratio increased to 13.8% (2018: 13.2%). 
CET1 capital decreased by £0.3bn to £40.8bn. This 
was driven by underlying profit generation of 
£5.0bn offset by dividends paid and foreseen of 
£2.4bn, the additional provision for PPI of £1.4bn, 
pension deficit reduction contribution payments of 
£0.5bn, a decrease in the currency translation 
reserve of £0.5bn, mainly driven by the 
depreciation of period end USD against GBP, and a 
loss on the redemption of AT1 securities of £0.4bn. 
RWAs decreased by £16.8bn to £295.1bn primarily 
driven by the reduction in the Group's operational 
risk RWAs, as well as the depreciation of period end 
USD against GBP.

Group target: CET1 ratio of c.13.5%. Revised from 
c.13.0% during the period, to reflect the removal of 
the operational risk RWAs floor which increased the 
CET1 ratio by c.60bps.

CET1 ratio 

 13.8%
2018: 13.2%

Definition Why is it important and how the Group performed

Average UK leverage ratio
The ratio is calculated as the average 
transitional Tier 1 capital divided by average 
UK leverage exposure. The average exposure 
measure excludes qualifying central bank 
claims.

The leverage ratio is non-risk based and is intended 
to act as a supplementary measure to the 
risk-based capital metrics such as the CET1 ratio.

The average UK leverage ratio remained stable at 
4.5% (2018: 4.5%) primarily driven by a net 
increase in AT1 capital, offset by a modest increase 
in leverage exposure to £1,143bn (2018: £1,110bn).

Group target: maintaining the UK leverage ratio 
above the expected minimum requirement.

Average UK leverage ratio 

4.5%
2018: 4.5%
2017: 4.9%

Return on average tangible 
shareholders' equity
RoTE is calculated as profit after tax 
attributable to ordinary shareholders, as a 
proportion of average shareholders' equity 
excluding non-controlling interests and other 
equity instruments adjusted for the deduction 
of intangible assets and goodwill.

This measure indicates the return generated 
by the management of the business based on 
shareholders' tangible equity. Achieving a target 
RoTE demonstrates the organisation's ability to 
execute its strategy and align management's 
interests with the shareholders'. RoTE lies at 
the heart of the Group's capital allocation and 
performance management process. 

RoTE for the Group, excluding litigation and 
conduct, increased to 9.0% (2018: 8.5%), in line 
with the 2019 target. Based on an average target 
CET1 ratio of 13.2%, RoTE was also 9%.

RoTE for the Group was 5.3% (2018: 3.6%) due to 
an attributable profit of £2,461m (2018: £1,597m) 
which included charges for litigation and conduct 
of £1.8bn, reflecting an additional PPI provision.

Group target: Group RoTE, excluding litigation 
and conduct, of greater than 10%.

Operating expenses
Operating expenses excluding litigation and 
conduct. 

Barclays views operating expenses as a key 
strategic area for banks; those who actively 
manage costs and control them effectively 
will gain a strong competitive advantage.

Group operating expenses were £13.6bn, in line 
with 2019 guidance, while total operating expenses 
were £15.4bn (2018: £16.2bn).

Total operating expenses

Cost: income ratio 
Operating expenses divided by  
total income.

This is a measure management uses to assess 
the productivity of the business operations. 
Managing the cost base is a key execution priority 
for management and includes a review of all 
categories of discretionary spending and an 
analysis of how we can run the business to ensure 
that costs increase at a slower rate than income.

The Group cost: income ratio, excluding litigation 
and conduct, decreased to 63% (2018: 66%) as 
favourable income and cost efficiencies were 
partially offset by continued investment. 

The Group cost: income ratio, including litigation 
and conduct, decreased to 71% (2018: 77%) due 
to increased income and favourable total operating 
expenses, which included an additional PPI 
provision.

Group target: a cost: income ratio of below 60% 
over time.

Notes
a From 2019, due to an IAS 12 update, the tax relief on payments in relation to AT1 instruments has been recognised in the tax charge of the income statement, whereas it was 

previously recorded in retained earnings. Comparatives have been restated, reducing the tax charge for 2018 by £211m, 2017 by £174m, 2016 by £128m and 2015 by £70m. This 
change does not impact earnings per share or return on average tangible shareholders' equity. Further detail can be found in Note 1.

b Refer to pages 228 to 230 for further information and calculations of performance measures excluding litigation and conduct.

FINANCIAL REVIEW

2019 compared to 2018
RoTE, excluding litigation and conduct, 
increased to 9.0% (2018: 8.5%), in line with 
the 2019 target. Statutory EPS was 14.3p 
(2018: 9.4p) and diluted EPS was 14.1p 
(2018: 9.2p).

Profit before tax was £4,357m (2018: 
£3,494m), including an additional provision 
for PPI of £1,400m (2018: £400m). Excluding 
litigation and conduct, profit before tax was 
£6,206m (2018: £5,701m), with higher 
income and lower operating expenses partially 
offset by increased year on year credit 
impairment charges. The 4% appreciation of 
average USD against GBP positively impacted 
income and profits and adversely impacted 
credit impairment charges and operating 
expenses.

Total income increased 2% to £21,632m. 
Barclays UK income was stable, as ongoing 
margin pressure and continued reduced risk 
appetite in UK cards were offset by mortgage 
and deposit balance growth. Barclays 
International income increased 5%, with CIB 
income up 5% and CC&P income up 4%. 
Within CIB, Markets income increased due to 
continued market share gainsa, while Banking 
fees income was stable and a reduction in 
Corporate lending income was partially offset 
by an increase in Transaction banking income. 
Higher CC&P income reflected growth in US 
co-branded cards and payments partnerships.

Credit impairment charges increased to 
£1,912m (2018: £1,468m). The 2019 charge 
includes the impact of macroeconomic 
scenario updates and an overall reduction 
in unsecured gross exposures. Prior year 
comparatives included the impact of 
favourable macroeconomic scenario updates 
and a £150m charge regarding the anticipated 
economic uncertainty in the UK.

Operating expenses decreased to £13,585m 
(2018: £13,896m) in line with 2019 guidance, 
as cost efficiencies were partially offset by 
continued investment. Barclays UK and 
Barclays International each generated positive 
cost: income jaws, resulting in the Group cost: 
income ratio, excluding litigation and conduct, 
reducing to 63% (2018: 66%).

Total operating expenses of £15,434m 
(2018: £16,243m) included litigation and 
conduct charges of £1,849m (2018: £2,207m).

The effective tax rate was 23.0% (2018: 
26.1%). Excluding litigation and conduct, 
the effective tax rate was 18.0% (2018: 17.2%). 
The Group's effective tax rate for future 
periods is expected to remain around 20%, 
excluding litigation and conduct.

Attributable profit was £2,461m (2018: 
£1,597m). Excluding litigation and conduct, 
attributable profit was £4,194m (2018: 
£3,733m), generating an RoTE of 9.0% 
(2018: 8.5%) and EPS of 24.4p (2018: 21.9p).

Total assets
Total assets increased £7bn to £1,140bn.

Cash and balances at central banks has 
decreased by £27bn to £150bn. The cash 
balance has reduced as the Group actively 
managed the cash component of the liquidity 
pool it holds to meet its funding and 
regulatory requirements. This management 
has seen a change in the composition of the 
liquidity pool and an increase in the 
proportion of debt securities held within it. 
The change in holding of liquid debt securities 
can be seen through the increase in assets 
held at fair value through other 
comprehensive income of £13bn to £66bn.

Cash collateral and settlement balances 
increased by £6bn to £83bn, primarily driven 
by derivative fair value changes.

Loans and advances at amortised cost 
increased £13bn to £339bn, principally driven 
by a £6bn increase in mortgage lending in 
Barclays UK and a £3bn increase in debt 
securities held as part of treasury funding 
and liquidity pool requirements.

Trading portfolio assets increased £10bn to 
£114bn due to increased trading activity, 
principally relating to the Equities business.

Financial assets at fair value through the 
income statement decreased £17bn to £133bn 
as a result of more capital efficient secured 
lending within Barclays International.

Derivative financial instrument assets 
increased £6bn to £229bn, driven by a 
decrease in major interest rate curves, partially 
offset by a decrease in foreign exchange 
volumes.

Total liabilities
Total liabilities increased £5bn to £1,075bn.

Deposits at amortised cost increased £21bn 
to £416bn driven by increased deposit taking 
within Personal and Business Banking and the 
broadening of the CIB business across Europe.

Debt securities in issue decreased £6bn to 
£76bn due to the maturity of a number of 
issuances which were not refinanced.

Financial liabilities designated at fair value 
decreased £13bn to £204bn as a result of 
more capital efficient secured lending within 
Barclays International.

Derivative financial instruments liabilities 
increased £9bn to £229bn, driven by a 
decrease in major interest rate curves, partially 
offset by a decrease in foreign exchange 
volumes. This is consistent with the 
movement in derivative financial instrument 
assets.

Total shareholders' equity
Total shareholders' equity increased £1.8bn 
to £64.4bn.

Share capital and share premium increased 
£0.3bn to £4.6bn as a result of shares issued 
under employee share schemes and the Scrip 
Dividend Programme.

Other equity instruments increased £1.3bn 
to £10.9bn due to the issuance of three AT1 
instruments with principal amounts of $2.0bn, 
£1.0bn and £1.0bn, partially offset by 
redemptions with principal amounts of 
$1.2bn, €1.1bn and £0.7bn. AT1 securities are 
perpetual subordinated contingent convertible 
securities structured to qualify as AT1 
instruments under prevailing capital rules 
applicable as at the relevant issue date.

The fair value through other comprehensive 
income reserve represents the unrealised 
change in the fair value through other 
comprehensive income investments since 
initial recognition. The reserve remained 
broadly flat at £0.2bn.

The cash flow hedging reserve increased 
£0.3bn to £1.0bn as a result of the fair value 
movements on interest rate swaps held for 
hedging purposes, as interest rate forward 
curves flattened across major currencies.

The currency translation reserve decreased 
£0.5bn to £3.3bn due to strengthening of 
GBP against USD and EUR of 3% and 5% 
respectively, when comparing year-end 
closing rates.

The own credit reserve decreased £0.3bn 
to £0.4bn debit, reflecting a tightening of 
Barclays' credit spreads increasing the fair 
value of liabilities on balance sheet.

Retained earnings increased £0.7bn to 
£44.2bn due to profits of £2.5bn, partially 
offset by dividends paid of £1.2bn, foreign 
exchange impact on redemption of AT1 
instruments of £0.4bn and pension reserve 
remeasurement of £0.2bn.

Tangible net asset value per share was 
unchanged at 262p (2018: 262p) as 14.3p 
earnings per share were offset by dividend 
payments of 7p per share and net negative 
reserve movements of 7p, predominantly 
in the currency translation reserve.

2019 compared to 2018
Profit before tax, excluding litigation and 
conduct, increased 7% to £2,604m and RoTE 
increased to 17.5% (2018: 16.7%) reflecting 
the resilience of the business in a challenging 
income environment. Including litigation and 
conduct charges of £1,582m (2018: £483m), 
profit before tax was £1,022m (2018: 
£1,956m).

Total income was stable at £7,353m (2018: 
£7,383m). A 2% reduction in net interest 
income to £5,888m (resulting in a lower NIM 
of 3.09% (2018: 3.23%)) reflected higher 
refinancing activity by mortgage customers, 
lower IEL balances in UK cards and the mix 
effect from growth in secured lending. Net fee, 
commission and other income increased 8% 
to £1,465m, due to increased debt sales and 
the impact of treasury operations.

Personal Banking income was stable at 
£4,009m (2018: £4,006m), reflecting ongoing 
mortgage margin pressure, offset by 
mortgage and deposit balance growth, 
improved deposit margins and treasury 
operations. 

Barclaycard Consumer UK income decreased 
5% to £1,992m reflecting a continued reduced 
risk appetite and reduced borrowing by 
customers, which resulted in a lower level of 
IEL balances, partially offset by increased debt 
sales. 

Business Banking income increased 6% to 
£1,352m driven by deposit growth, with 
improved deposit margins, and the non-
recurrence of client remediation in 2018.

Credit impairment charges decreased 14% 
to £712m reflecting the non-recurrence of a 
£100m specific charge in Q418 relating to the 
impact of anticipated economic uncertainty 
in the UK. Unsecured gross exposures were 
lower as a result of increased debt sales and 
an improved risk profile, both principally in UK 
cards. The 30 and 90 day arrears rates in UK 
cards decreased to 1.7% (Q418: 1.8%) and 
0.8% (Q418: 0.9%) respectively.

Operating expenses decreased 2% to £4,037m 
as cost efficiencies were partially offset by 
planned investment and inflation. The cost: 
income ratio, excluding litigation and conduct, 
was 55% (2018: 56%).

Loans and advances to customers at 
amortised cost increased 3% to £193.7bn 
reflecting £6.4bn of mortgage growth.

Customer deposits at amortised cost 
increased 4% to £205.5bn demonstrating 
franchise strength across both Personal and 
Business Banking.

RWAs were stable at £74.9bn (2018: £75.2bn) 
as a reduction in UK cards (reflecting 
increased debt sales, lower IEL balances and 
an improved risk profile) was offset by growth 
in mortgages.

2019 compared to 2018
Profit before tax, excluding litigation and 
conduct, increased 9% to £4,234m with an 
RoTE of 9.3% (2018: 8.7%), reflecting returns 
in the CIB of 8.0% (2018: 7.1%) and CC&P of 
15.9% (2018: 17.3%).

The 4% appreciation of average USD against 
GBP positively impacted income and profits, 
and adversely impacted credit impairment 
charges and operating expenses.

Total income increased to £14,675m (2018: 
£14,026m).

CIB income increased 5% to £10,231m. 
Markets income increased 7% to £5,251m 
reflecting further gains in market share in a 
declining revenue poola. 

FICC income increased 17% to £3,364m 
reflecting a strong performance in rates and 
growth in securitised products. Equities 
income decreased 7% to £1,887m driven by 
equity derivatives, which were impacted by 
reduced client activity. Included in Markets 
was a £180m gain related to the Tradeweb 
position and a net loss of £77m due to the 
impact of treasury operations and hedging 
counterparty risk.

Banking fees income was stable at £2,535m. 
The business continued to gain market share 
in a declining fee poolb. Within Corporate, 
Transaction banking income increased 3% to 
£1,680m reflecting growth in deposits. This 
was offset by a decrease in Corporate lending 
income to £765m (2018: £878m). Excluding 
mark-to-market movements on loan hedges, 
Corporate lending income was broadly stable.

CC&P income increased 4% to £4,444m 
reflecting growth in US co-branded cards and 
payments partnerships.

Credit impairment charges increased to 
£1,173m (2018: £658m). CIB credit 
impairment charges increased to £157m 
(2018: release of £150m) due to the non-
recurrence of favourable macroeconomic 
scenario updates and single name recoveries 
in 2018. CC&P credit impairment charges 
increased to £1,016m (2018: £808m), 
reflecting the non-recurrence of favourable US 
macroeconomic scenario updates in 2018, as 
well as higher unsecured gross exposures due 
to balance growth in cards. Credit metrics 
remained stable, with 30 and 90 day arrears 
rates in US cards of 2.7% (Q418: 2.7%) and 
1.4% (Q418: 1.4%) respectively.

Operating expenses decreased 2% to 
£9,337m. CIB operating expenses decreased 
3% to £7,038m as cost efficiencies were 
partially offset by continued investment. CC&P 
operating expenses increased 2% to £2,299m 
reflecting continued investment.

Loans and advances increased £5.6bn to 
£132.8bn mainly due to an increase in debt 
securities.

Trading portfolio assets increased £9.3bn to 
£113.3bn due to increased trading activity, 
principally relating to the Equities business.

Derivative financial instrument assets and 
liabilities increased £6.8bn to £228.9bn and 
£9.3bn to £228.9bn respectively, driven by a 
decrease in major interest rate curves, partially 
offset by a decrease in foreign exchange 
volumes.

Financial assets at fair value through the 
income statement decreased £16.3bn to 
£128.4bn driven by a focus on capital-efficient 
secured financing.

Other assets decreased £11.2bn to £178.6bn 
predominantly due to a reduction in cash at 
central banks held as part of the liquidity pool.

Deposits at amortised cost increased £12.8bn 
to £210.0bn due to increased deposits within 
CIB including the broadening of the business 
across Europe.

RWAs decreased to £209.2bn (December 
2018: £210.7bn) driven predominantly by 
depreciation of USD against GBP.

Notes
a  From 2019, due to an IAS 12 update, the tax relief on payments in relation to AT1 instruments has been recognised in the tax charge of the income statement, whereas it was 

previously recorded in retained earnings. Comparatives have been restated. This change does not impact EPS or return on average tangible shareholders' equity.
b  Refer to pages 228 to 230 for more information and calculations of performance measures excluding litigation and conduct.

2019 compared to 2018
Loss before tax, excluding litigation and 
conduct, was £632m (2018: £640m). 
Including litigation and conduct charges of 
£151m (2018: £1,597m), loss before tax was 
£783m (2018: £2,237m), which reflected the 
non-recurrence of the £1,420m Residential 
Mortgage Backed Securities settlement in 
2018.

Total income was an expense of £396m 
(2018: £273m), which included the funding 
costs of legacy capital instruments, treasury 
items and hedge accounting expenses, 
partially offset by the recognition of dividends 
on Barclays' stake in Absa Group Limited. The 
increase in income expense was mainly due to 
the non-recurrence of a £155m one-off gain in 
2018 from the settlement of receivables 
relating to the Lehman Brothers acquisition.

Average allocated tangible equity increased 
to £5.1bn (2018: £3.1bn) mainly due to excess 
capital held in Head Office as a result of the 
Group's average CET1 ratio for 2019 being 
above the 13.0% used in the allocation of 
equity to the businesses.

RWAs decreased to £11.0bn (December 2018: 
£26.0bn) mainly driven by the removal of the 
Group's operational risk RWAs floor.

The Barclays Non-Core segment was closed 
on 1 July 2017 with the residual assets and 
liabilities reintegrated into, and associated 
financial performance subsequently reported 
in, Barclays UK, Barclays International and 
Head Office. Financial results up until 30 June 
2017 are reflected in the Non-Core segment 
within the Group's results for the year ended

Note
a The Africa Banking income statement represents five months of results as a discontinued operation to 31 May 2017.

Following the reduction of the Group's interest 
in BAGL in 2017, Barclays' remaining holding 
of 14.9%, for the year ended 31 December 
2019, is reported as a financial asset at fair 
value through other comprehensive income in 
the Head Office segment, with Barclays' share 
of Absa Group Limited's dividend recognised 
in the Head Office income statement.

Barclays' shareholding in Absa Group Limited 
of 14.9% is treated as a 250% risk weighted 
asset, since the PRA agreed to Barclays fully 
deconsolidating BAGL for regulatory reporting 
purposes, effective 30 June 2018. Barclays had 
been applying proportional consolidation for 
regulatory purposes since Q2 2017.

FINANCIAL REVIEW

Non-IFRS performance measures

The Group's management believes that the non-IFRS performance measures included in this document provide valuable information to the 
readers of the financial statements as they enable the reader to identify a more consistent basis for comparing the businesses' performance 
between financial periods, and provide more detail concerning the elements of performance which the managers of these businesses are most 
directly able to influence or are relevant for an assessment of the Group. They also reflect an important aspect of the way in which operating 
targets are defined and performance is monitored by management. However, any non-IFRS performance measures in this document are not a 
substitute for IFRS measures and readers should consider the IFRS measures as well.

Non-IFRS performance measures glossary

Measure Definition

Loan: deposit ratio Loans and advances at amortised cost divided by deposits at amortised cost. The components 
of the calculation have been included on page 183.

Period end allocated tangible equity Allocated tangible equity is calculated as 13.0% (2018: 13.0%) of RWAs for each business, 
adjusted for capital deductions, excluding goodwill and intangible assets, reflecting the 
assumptions the Group uses for capital planning purposes. Head Office allocated tangible equity 
represents the difference between the Group's tangible shareholders' equity and the amounts 
allocated to businesses.

Average tangible shareholders' equity Calculated as the average of the previous month's period end tangible equity and the current 
month's period end tangible equity. The average tangible shareholders' equity for the period is 
the average of the monthly averages within that period.

Average allocated tangible equity Calculated as the average of the previous month's period end allocated tangible equity and the 
current month's period end allocated tangible equity. The average allocated tangible equity for 
the period is the average of the monthly averages within that period.

Return on average tangible  
shareholders' equity

Statutory profit after tax attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent, as a proportion of 
average shareholders' equity excluding non-controlling interests and other equity instruments 
adjusted for the deduction of intangible assets and goodwill. The components of the calculation 
have been included on page 227.

Return on average allocated tangible equity Statutory profit after tax attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent, as a proportion of 
average allocated tangible equity. The components of the calculation have been included on 
page 227.

Cost: income ratio Total operating expenses divided by total income.

Loan loss rate Quoted in basis points and represents total impairment charges divided by gross loans and 
advances held at amortised cost at the balance sheet date. The components of the calculation 
have been included on page 151.

Net interest margin Net interest income divided by the sum of average customer assets. The components of the 
calculation have been included on page 227.

Tangible net asset value per share Calculated by dividing shareholders' equity, excluding non-controlling interests and other equity 
instruments, less goodwill and intangible assets, by the number of issued ordinary shares. 
The components of the calculation have been included on page 230.

Performance measures excluding  
litigation and conduct

Calculated by excluding litigation and conduct charges from performance measures. 
The components of the calculations have been included on pages 228 to 230.

Otherc (502) (932)
Total Barclays Group 9,407 9,062

Notes
a The Group's treasury results are reported directly within Barclays UK and Barclays International from Q218 following ring-fencing, resulting in gains and losses made on certain 

activities being recognised as Other income, rather than in Net interest income.
b Barclays International margins include interest earning lending balances within the investment banking business.
c Other includes Head Office and non-lending related investment banking businesses not included in Barclays International margins.

The Group net interest margin decreased 11bps to 3.42% and Barclays UK net interest margin decreased 14bps to 3.09%, primarily reflecting increased 
refinancing activity by mortgage customers and competitive pressure, lower IEL in UK cards and the mix effect from growth in secured lending.

The Group combined product and equity structural hedge notional as at 31 December 2019 was £171bn, with an average duration of 2.5 to 3 
years. Group net interest income includes gross structural hedge contributions of £1.8bn (2018: £1.7bn) and net structural hedge contributions 
of £0.5bn (2018: £0.8bn). Gross structural hedge contributions represent the absolute level of interest earned from the fixed receipts on the basket 
of swaps in the structural hedge, while the net structural hedge contributions represent the net interest earned on the difference between the 
structural hedge rate and prevailing floating rates.

Returns
Return on average tangible equity is calculated as profit for the period attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent divided by average 
tangible equity for the period, excluding non-controlling and other equity interests for businesses. Allocated tangible equity has been calculated 
as 13.0% (2018: 13.0%) of RWAs for each business, adjusted for capital deductions, excluding goodwill and intangible assets, reflecting the 
assumptions the Group uses for capital planning purposes. Head Office average allocated tangible equity represents the difference between the 
Group's average tangible shareholders' equity and the amounts allocated to businesses.

Independent Auditor's report  
to the members of Barclays PLC

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

1 Our opinion is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements 
of Barclays PLC (“the Parent company”) for 
the year ended 31 December 2019 which 
comprise the consolidated and Parent 
company balance sheets as at 31 December 
2019 and the consolidated income statement, 
consolidated and Parent company statements 
of comprehensive income, cash flow 
statements and statements of changes in 
equity for the year then ended, and the related 
notes, including the accounting policies in 
note 1.

In our opinion the financial statements:

■■ give a true and fair view of the state of 
the Group's and of the Parent company's 
affairs as at 31 December 2019 and of the 
Group's profit for the year then ended; 

■■ have been properly prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European 
Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU); 

■■ have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 
and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 

Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance 
with International Standards on Auditing 
(UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. 
Our responsibilities are described below. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is a sufficient and appropriate 
basis for our opinion. Our audit opinion 
is consistent with our report to the 
audit committee. 

We were first appointed as auditor by the 
Directors on 31 March 2017. The period of 
total uninterrupted engagement is for the 3 
financial years ended 31 December 2019. We 
have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, 
and we remain independent of the Group in 
accordance with, UK ethical requirements 
including the FRC Ethical Standard as applied 
to listed public interest entities. No non-audit 
services prohibited by that standard were 
provided.

2 Key audit matters: our 
assessment of risks of 
material misstatement
Key audit matters are those matters that, in 
our professional judgement, were of most 
significance in the audit of the financial 
statements and include the most significant 
assessed risks of material misstatement 
(whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, 
including those which had the greatest effect 
on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of 
resources in the audit; and directing the 
efforts of the engagement team. We 
summarise below the key audit matters, in 
decreasing order of audit significance, in 
arriving at our audit opinion above, together 
with our key audit procedures to address 
those matters and, as required for public 
interest entities, our results from those 
procedures.

In the prior year, we reported a key audit 
matter in respect of the impact of 
uncertainties due to the UK exiting the 
European Union. As a result of developments 
since the prior year report, including the 
Group's own preparation, the relative 
significance of this matter on our audit work, 
including in relation to the impairment 
allowance which remains a key audit matter, 
has reduced. Accordingly, we no longer 
consider this a key audit matter.

These matters were addressed, and our results 
are based on procedures undertaken, in the 
context of, and solely for the purpose of, our 
audit of the financial statements as a whole, 
and in forming our opinion thereon, and 
consequently are incidental to that opinion, 
and we do not provide a separate opinion on 
these matters.

Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Impairment allowances on loans and advances at 
amortised cost, including off-balance sheet elements

31 December 2019 £6.6bn, 31 December 2018 £7.0bn

Refer to page 55 (Board Audit Committee Report), page 259 
(accounting policy on accounting for the impairment of financial 
assets), page 147 (credit risk disclosures), and page 259 
(financial disclosure note 7 Credit impairment charges)

Subjective estimate
The estimation of expected credit losses (“ECL”) on financial 
instruments, involves significant judgement and estimates. The 
key areas where we identified greater levels of management 
judgement and therefore increased levels of audit focus in the 
Group's estimation of ECLs are:

■■ Model estimations – Inherently judgemental modelling is 
used to estimate ECLs which involves determining 
Probabilities of Default “PD”), Loss Given Default (“LGD”), 
and Exposures at Default (“EAD”). The PD models are the key 
drivers of the ECLs and also impact the staging of assets and 
as a result are considered the most significant judgemental 
aspect of the Group's ECL modelling approach especially for 
the UK and US credit cards, UK consumer loans and 
corporate portfolios.

■■ Economic scenarios – IFRS 9 requires the Group to measure 
ECLs on an unbiased forward-looking basis reflecting a range 
of future economic conditions. Significant management 
judgement is applied in determining the economic scenarios 
used and the probability weightings applied to them 
especially when considering the current uncertain economic 
environment in the UK and US, including the manner in 
which the UK withdraws from the European Union. This 
especially impacts the UK and US credit cards, UK mortgages, 
UK consumer loans and corporate portfolios.

■■ Qualitative adjustments – Adjustments to the model-driven 
ECL results are raised by management to address known 
impairment model limitations or emerging trends. They 
represent approximately 5.4% net of the ECL. Such 
adjustments are inherently uncertain and significant 
management judgement is involved in estimating these 
amounts especially in relation to the UK and US credit cards 
and corporate portfolios.

The effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk assessment, 
we determined that the impairment of loans and advances to 
customers including off balance sheet elements has a high 
degree of estimation uncertainty, with a potential range of 
reasonable outcomes greater than our materiality for the 
financial statements as a whole, and possibly many times that 
amount. The credit risk sections of the financial statements 
disclose the sensitivities estimated by the Group.

Disclosure quality
The disclosures regarding the Group's application of IFRS 9 are 
key to explaining the key judgements and material inputs to the 
IFRS 9 ECL results.

Our procedures included:

Controls testing: We performed end to end process walk-throughs to identify 
the key systems, applications and controls used in the ECL processes. We 
tested the relevant general IT and applications controls over key systems used 
in the ECL process.

Key aspects of our controls testing involved the following:

■■ For the relevant portfolios, testing the design and operating effectiveness 
of the key controls over the completeness and accuracy of the key inputs 
and assumptions into the IFRS 9 impairment models;

■■ Testing the design and operating effectiveness of the key controls over the 
application of the staging criteria;

■■ Evaluating controls over validation, implementation and model monitoring;
■■ Evaluating controls over authorisation and calculation of post model 

adjustments and management overlays; and
■■ Testing key controls relating to selection and implementation of material 

macro-economic variables and the controls over the scenario selection 
and probabilities.

Our financial risk modelling expertise: For the UK and US credit cards, UK 
consumer loans and corporate portfolios we involved our own financial risk 
modelling specialists in the following:

■■ Evaluating the appropriateness of the Group's IFRS 9 impairment 
methodologies (including the staging criteria used);

■■ Re-performing the calculation of certain components of the ECL model 
calculation (including the staging criteria);

■■ For a sample of models which were changed or updated during the year, 
evaluating whether the changes (including the updated model code) were 
consistent with the Barclays' approved IFRS 9 impairment methodologies 
by re-performing key model validation procedures; and 

■■ For a sample of material models, assessing the reasonableness of the 
model predictions by comparing them against actual results and 
evaluating the resulting differences. 

Our economic scenario expertise: We involved our own economic specialists 
to assist us in assessing the appropriateness of the Group's methodology for 
determining the economic scenarios used and the probability weightings 
applied to them. We assessed key economic variables such as UK and US GDP, 
unemployment and house prices indices, which included agreeing samples of 
economic variables to external sources. We also assessed the overall 
reasonableness of the economic forecasts by comparing the Group's forecasts 
to our own modelled forecasts, with a focus on the UK and US credit card, UK 
mortgages, UK consumer loans and corporate portfolios. We also assessed 
the reasonableness of the Group's considerations of the ECL impact of 
anticipated economic uncertainty in the UK. 

Test of details: Key aspects of our testing involved:

■■ Sample testing over key inputs and assumptions impacting ECL 
calculations to assess the reasonableness of economic forecasts, weights, 
and PD assumptions applied; and

■■ Selecting a sample of post model adjustments, considering the size and 
complexity of management overlays, in order to assess the reasonableness of 
the adjustments by challenging key assumptions, inspecting the calculation 
methodology and tracing a sample of the data used back to source data.

Assessing transparency: We assessed whether the disclosures appropriately 
disclose and address the uncertainty which exists when determining the 
expected credit losses. As a part of this, we assessed the sensitivity analysis 
that is disclosed. In addition, we assessed whether the disclosure of the key 
judgements and assumptions made was sufficiently clear.

Our results:
The results of our testing were satisfactory and we considered the ECL 
charge, provision recognised and the related disclosures to be acceptable 
(2018 result: acceptable).

Independent Auditor's report  
to the members of Barclays PLC
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Provision for conduct redress costs (PPI)

31 December 2019 £1.2bn, 31 December 2018 £0.9bn

Refer to page 55 (Board Audit Committee Report), page 300 
(accounting policy on accounting for provisions), and page 300 
(financial disclosure note 24 Provisions)

Subjective estimate
The calculation of the provision for Payment Protection 
Insurance (“PPI”) redress costs for the Group requires the 
Directors to make a number of key assumptions regarding the 
redress still to be paid. The determination of these is judgmental 
and requires the Directors to consider a range of information. 

The Group received a higher than expected volume of 
complaints, enquiries and requests for information in the run up 
to the FCA time-bar in August 2019, including a volume related 
to enquiries received from the Official Receiver. The most 
significant assumptions in the PPI provision calculation are the 
proportion of complaints and other claims for which redress will 
be payable and judgements around the legal position of 
enquiries from the Official Receiver and these areas are where 
we have focused our procedures.

The Directors have developed a model which estimates the 
proportion of complaints, enquiries and requests for information 
(“RFIs”) for which redress will be payable and the associated 
redress cost. 

The Directors have assessed the appropriateness of the provision 
with reference to historical observed complaints data, and more 
recent experience observed in complaints and other claims 
received in the period shortly before the time-bar.

The effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk assessment, 
we determined that PPI provision costs have significant 
estimation uncertainty, with a potential range of reasonable 
outcomes greater than our materiality for the financial 
statements as a whole.

Disclosure quality
The related PPI disclosures provide the key assumptions 
underpinning the calculation of the provision and sensitivity of 
the provision to the changes in those assumptions and are 
therefore key to understanding the judgement which has been 
applied.

Our procedures included:

Historical comparison: We evaluated the assumptions and data used, 
particularly those in relation to complaint volumes and validity which led to 
an adjustment to provision estimates in 2019.

Enquiry of regulators: We inspected correspondence with the FCA and other 
regulators to identify any regulatory observations on the PPI redress provision. 
We also made enquiries of the FCA discussing the nature of the matters 
contained in regulatory correspondence that could materially affect the level 
of provisions held.

Controls testing: We tested the design and operating effectiveness of the key 
controls over capturing of complaints data and assumptions applied in the 
estimation of redress payments to be made. 

Sensitivity analysis: We considered the appropriateness of the scenarios used 
to model the potential range of outcomes. We also considered the sensitivity 
of the model to variations in redress assumptions by inspecting the 
calculation methodology and challenging the key assumptions using our 
industry knowledge.

Enquiry of lawyers: For Official Receiver enquiries we enquired of the Group's 
external legal counsel and inspected legal reports and correspondence from 
the Official Receiver to challenge whether the provision reflects most recent 
developments. 

Independent re-performance: We built our own model to allow us to 
determine a range of potential future outcomes under multiple independently 
selected scenarios and used these to assess the appropriateness of the 
Group's point estimate. We developed a number of these scenarios using 
analysis of Barclays' historical complaint data. Where there were differences in 
the inputs and ranges we challenged the Group's rationale for these and 
assessed whether they were reasonable. 

Assessing transparency: We assessed whether the disclosures appropriately 
disclose and address the significant uncertainty which exists when estimating 
the PPI redress provision. As a part of this, we re-performed the sensitivity 
analysis that is disclosed. 

Our results:
The results of our testing were satisfactory and we considered the provision 
recognised, and sensitivity disclosures made, to be acceptable. (2018 result: 
acceptable).

Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Valuation of financial instruments held at fair value

Refer to page 56 (Board Audit Committee Report), page 249 
(accounting policy for financial assets and liabilities) and page 
279 (financial disclosure note 17 Fair value of financial 
instruments)

Subjective valuation
The fair value of the Group's financial instruments is determined 
through the application of valuation techniques which often involve 
the exercise of significant judgement by management in relation to 
the choice of the valuation models, pricing inputs and post-model 
pricing adjustments, including fair value adjustments (FVAs) and 
credit and funding adjustments (together referred to as XVAs)

Where significant pricing inputs are unobservable, management has 
no reliable, relevant market data available in determining the fair 
value and hence estimation uncertainty can be high. These financial 
instruments are classified as Level 3, with management having 
controls in place over the boundary between Level 2 and 3 positions. 
Our significant audit risk is therefore primarily over significant Level 3 
portfolios. 

In addition, there may also be valuation complexity associated with 
Level 2 portfolios, specifically where valuation modelling techniques 
result in significant limitations or where there is greater uncertainty 
around the choice of an appropriate pricing methodology, and 
consequently more than one valuation model is used for that 
product across the market. 

The effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk assessment, we 
determined that the subjective estimates in fair value measurement 
of certain portfolios, as detailed above, have a high degree of 
estimation uncertainty, with a potential range of reasonable 
outcomes greater than our materiality for the financial statements as 
a whole, and possibly many times that amount.

At 31 December 2019, Level 3 instruments (£18.7bn) represented 
2.6% of the Group's financial assets carried at fair value and 0.9% of 
the Group's financial liabilities carried at fair value.

Within this population the fair value instrument portfolios in the 
Group with the most significant judgements are:

■■ Fair value loan portfolios – we identified two fair value loan 
portfolios as having a significant audit risk: the Education, Social 
Housing and Local Authority (‘ESHLA') loan portfolio and fair 
value loans related to the Group's syndication activities. As at 
31 December 2019 the Group has outstanding ESHLA loans 
which require significant judgement in the valuation due to the 
long dated nature of the portfolio, the lack of a secondary market 
in the relevant loans and unobservable loan spreads. The fair 
value loan portfolio related to syndication activities also has 
significant judgement in the valuation due to the lack of 
observable prices.

■■ Derivative portfolios – we identified four portfolios each with a 
significant risk attached to the valuation methodology due to the 
lack of observable pricing inputs.

■■ Preference shares – we identified a portfolio of preference shares 
where the valuation is judgemental due to the unobservable 
inputs.

In addition, to these Level 3 portfolios, we also identified one derivatives 
portfolio that we considered to be harder to value Level 2 due to an 
element of modelling complexity associated with the product.

Disclosure quality
The IFRS 13 fair value measurement disclosures are key to 
explaining the valuation techniques, key judgements, 
assumptions and material inputs.

Our procedures included:

Risk assessment: We performed risk assessment procedures over the entire 
Level 2 and Level 3 balances within the Group's financial statements (i.e. all of 
the non-listed fair value financial instruments held by the Group). As part of 
these risk assessment procedures we identified which portfolios have a risk of 
material misstatement including those arising from significant judgements 
over valuation either due to unobservable inputs or complex models

Control testing: We tested the design and operating effectiveness of key 
controls relating specifically to these portfolios. These included:

■■ controls over independent price verification (“IPV”), performed by a 
control function, of key market pricing inputs, including completeness of 
positions and valuation inputs subject to IPV.

■■ controls over FVAs, including exit adjustments (to mark the portfolio to bid 
or offer prices), model shortcoming reserves to address model limitations 
and XVAs.

■■ controls over the validation, completeness, implementation and usage of 
valuation models. This included controls over assessment of model 
limitations and assumptions.

Independent re-performance: With the assistance of our own valuation 
specialists we independently re-priced a selection of trades from across the 
significant audit risk portfolios and challenged management on the valuations 
where they were outside our tolerance.

Methodology choice: Our own valuation specialists assisted us in challenging 
the appropriateness of significant models and methodologies used in 
calculating fair values, risk exposures and in calculating FVAs, including 
comparison to industry practice.

Comparing valuations: For a selection of material collateral disputes we 
challenged management's valuation methodology where significant fair value 
differences were observable with the market participant on the other side of 
the trade.

Historical comparison: We inspected significant gains and losses on trade 
exits or restructurings and challenged whether these data points indicate 
elements of fair value not incorporated in the current valuation 
methodologies. We also inspected movements in unobservable inputs 
throughout the period to challenge whether any gain or loss generated was 
appropriate.

Assessing transparency: We assessed the adequacy of the Group's financial 
statements disclosures in the context of the relevant accounting standards.

Our results:
The results of our testing were satisfactory and we considered the fair value 
of Level 3 and harder-to-value Level 2 financial instrument assets and 
liabilities recognised to be acceptable (2018 result: acceptable).

Provisions for legal, competition and regulatory 
related matters

31 December 2019 £376m, 31 December 2018 £414m

Refer to pages 300 and 302 (accounting policies on provisions and 
on contingent liabilities and commitments), page 300 (financial 
disclosure note 24 Provisions) and page 303 (financial disclosure 
note 26 Legal, competition and regulatory matters)

Exposure completeness
The Group and Parent company operate in a highly litigious and 
regulated environment and faces legal, competition and regulatory 
challenges which can lead to potential claims and exposures 
(together ‘legal, competition and regulatory matters'). In certain 
legal, competition and regulatory matters significant judgement is 
required by the Directors to determine if there is a present 
obligation under relevant accounting standards.

Subjective estimate
If there is a present obligation the amounts involved can be 
potentially significant, and the application of accounting 
standards to estimate the expected outflow, if any, of any provision 
to be recognised is inherently subjective.

The effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk assessment, 
we determined that the provisions for legal, competition and 
regulatory matters have a high degree of estimation uncertainty, 
with a potential range of reasonable outcomes greater than our 
materiality for the financial statements as a whole.

Contingent liabilities 
When a provision is not recognised for possible significant 
outflows, but there is more than a remote likelihood of an adverse 
outcome, the disclosure requirements under IAS 37 is key to 
understanding the risks and potential effect on the Group and 
Parent company.

Our procedures included:

Inspection of Board of Directors meeting minutes: We inspected the Board 
of Directors meeting minutes to obtain an understanding of the status of all 
significant legal, competition and regulatory matters.

Assessment of regulatory correspondence: We inspected correspondence 
with the relevant regulatory authorities to identify actual or possible 
non-compliance with laws and regulations that may have a material effect on 
the financial statements and for the most significant matters, enquired 
directly with the relevant regulator.

Enquiry of lawyers: For significant legal, competition and regulatory matters 
we enquired of the Group and Parent company's internal legal counsel and 
inspected internal notes and reports. For the most significant legal, 
competition and regulatory matters we also received formal confirmations 
from external counsel and had discussions with external counsel. Based on 
these procedures we challenged the timing of the recognition of provisions 
where there is potential exposure but it is not clear whether a present 
obligation exists.

Test of details: For the significant legal, competition and regulatory matters, 
we independently assessed the estimated value of the provisions, based on 
our enquiries of lawyers and information obtained from our other procedures.

Assessing transparency: We assessed whether the disclosures detailing 
significant legal, competition and regulatory matters adequately disclose the 
contingent liabilities and the significant uncertainties that exist.

Our results:
The results of our testing were satisfactory and we considered the provisions 
recognised, and the contingent liabilities disclosures made, to be acceptable 
(2018 result: acceptable).

Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter

User access management

Control performance
The Group's accounting and reporting processes are dependent 
on automated controls enabled by IT systems. User access 
management controls are an important component of the 
general IT control environment assuring that unauthorised 
access to systems do not impact the effective operation of the 
automated controls in the financial reporting processes. 

Key user access management controls continue to be reported 
as not being consistently implemented and effectively operated 
across the Group. Ineffective controls included privileged access, 
segregation of duties and user access recertification.

A series of remediation programmes were in place during the 
year to address previously identified control deficiencies. The 
Group has also enhanced compensating controls to address the 
issues raised, most of them relating to user access management.

If the above controls for user access management are deficient 
and not remediated or adequately mitigated, the pervasive 
nature of these controls may undermine our ability to place 
reliance on automated and IT dependent controls in our audit.

Our procedures included

Control testing: We tested the design and operating effectiveness of the 
relevant controls over user access management including: 

■■ Authorising access rights for new joiners;
■■ Timely removal of user access rights;
■■ Logging and monitoring of user activities;
■■ Privileged user and developer access to production systems, the 

procedures to assess granting, potential use, and the removal of these 
access rights;

■■ Segregation of duties including access to multiple systems that could 
circumvent segregation controls; and

■■ Re-certification of user access rights.

Control re-performance: To assess whether additional detective 
compensating controls adequately address the risk of unauthorised access, 
we re-performed on a sample basis management's assessment of potential 
unauthorised access by privileged accounts and users, whose access rights 
were not recertified.

Our results:
Our testing did not identify unauthorised user activities in the systems 
relevant to financial reporting which would have required us to expand the 
extent of our planned detailed testing.

Recoverability of Parent company's investment 
in subsidiaries

The carrying amount of the Parent company's investments in 
subsidiaries represents 60% (2018: 61%) of the Company's total 
assets. Their recoverability is not at a high risk of significant 
misstatement or subject to significant judgement. However, due 
to their materiality in the context of the Parent company 
financial statements, and considering the Group's current market 
capitalisation, this is considered to be the area that had the 
greatest effect on our overall Parent company audit.

Our procedures included:

Test of details: We compared the carrying amount of each subsidiary to its 
draft balance sheet to identify whether their net assets, being an 
approximation of their minimum recoverable amount, were in excess of their 
carrying amount and assessing whether those subsidiaries have historically 
been profit-making. In addition, for the two most significant subsidiaries, 
being Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Bank UK PLC,we have assessed 
recoverability through projection of future cash flows to ascertain if an 
impairment is required. Further we assessed the reasonableness of the Board 
approved future cash flow forecasts used and evaluating how discount rates 
used compared to our reasonable ranges.

Assessing subsidiary audits: We assessed the work performed by the 
subsidiary audit teams on the sample of those subsidiaries selected for test of 
details and considered the results of that work on those subsidiaries' profits 
and net assets.

Our results:
We found the Parent company's assessment of the recoverability of the 
investment in subsidiaries to be acceptable

3 Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit
Materiality
Materiality for the Group financial statements 
as a whole was set at £250 million (2018: 
£250 million), determined with reference to 
a benchmark of Group profit before tax from 
continuing operations, normalised to exclude 
charges related to conduct as disclosed in 
the consolidated financial statements of 
£1.4 billion, of which it represents 4.3%. 
In 2018, we normalised Group profit before 
tax to exclude charges for litigation and 
conduct risk.

Materiality for the Parent company financial 
statements as a whole was set at £245 million 
(2018: £235 million), determined with 
reference to a benchmark of net assets, of 
which it represents 0.4%. 

We agreed to report to the Board Audit 
Committee any corrected or uncorrected 
identified misstatements exceeding 
£12 million (2018: £12 million), in addition to 
other identified misstatements that warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds. 

Scope – general
We subjected two of the Group's reporting 
components to full scope audits for Group 
purposes. Our approach to scoping the two 
components was as follows: for one 
component, we instructed that component 
audit team to conduct and report to us on 
their own full scope Group audit and specified 
three components within that Group that 
should be subject to a full scope audit 
overseen by them; for the other component, 
we directly instructed the component audit 
team to conduct and report to us on a full 
scope audit. In the prior year, we received 
reporting directly from five components.

The components within the scope of our work 
accounted for the percentages illustrated 
below.

The remaining 7% (2018: 5%) of total Group 
income and 7% (2018: 7%) of total Group 
assets is represented by a number of other 
reporting components, none of which were 
individually significant. For these residual 
components, we performed analysis at an 
aggregated Group level to re-examine our 
assessment that there were no significant 
risks of material misstatement within these.

The work on all components was performed 
by component auditors and the remaining 
work, including the audit of the Parent 
company, was performed by the Group team. 
For those items excluded from normalised 
Group profit before tax, the component teams 
performed procedures on items relating to 
their components.

Team structure
The Group team led a global planning 
conference to discuss key audit risks and 
to obtain input from component and other 
participating locations. The Group team 
instructed component auditors as to the 
significant areas to be covered, including the 
relevant key audit matters detailed above and 
the information to be reported back. The 
Group team reviewed and approved the 
component materiality for both components 
including scoping and risk assessment. The 
materiality for the two components ranged 
from £100 million to £135 million, having 
regard to the sizes and risk profiles of the 
components. 

The Group team visited all of the components 
in scope for Group reporting purposes to 
assess the audit risk and strategy. Conference 
meetings and calls were also held with these 
component auditors throughout the conduct 
of the audit. At these visits and meetings, we 
reviewed the components' key working 
papers, the findings reported to the Group 
team were discussed in more detail, and any 
further work required by the Group team was 
then performed by the component auditor.

The Group has centralised certain Group-wide 
processes in India, the outputs of which are 
included in the financial information of the 
reporting components it services and 
therefore it is not a separate reporting 
component. These Group wide processes 
are subject to specified audit procedures, 
predominantly the testing of transaction 
processing, reconciliations and review

controls. Additional procedures are performed 
at certain reporting components to address 
the audit risks not covered by the work 
performed over these Group-wide processes 
in India. The Group team and certain 
component teams visited the locations in 
India where these Group-wide processes 
reside and performed consistent procedures 
as described above for component site visits.

4 We have nothing to report on 
going concern 
The Directors have prepared the financial 
statements on the going concern basis as they 
do not intend to liquidate the Company or the 
Group or to cease their operations, and as 
they have concluded that the Company's and 
the Group's financial position means that this 
is realistic. They have also concluded that 
there are no material uncertainties that could 
have cast significant doubt over their ability to 
continue as a going concern for at least a year 
from the date of approval of the financial 
statements (“the going concern period”). 

Our responsibility is to conclude on the 
appropriateness of the Directors' conclusions 
and, had there been a material uncertainty 
related to going concern, to make reference to 
that in this audit report. However, as we 
cannot predict all future events or conditions 
and as subsequent events may result in 
outcomes that are inconsistent with 
judgements that were reasonable at the time 
they were made, the absence of reference to a 
material uncertainty in this auditor's report is 
not a guarantee that the Group and the 
Company will continue in operation. 

In our evaluation of the Directors' conclusions, 
we considered the inherent risks to the 
Group's and Company's business model and 
analysed how those risks might affect the 
Group's and Company's financial resources or 
ability to continue operations over the going 
concern period. The risks that we considered 
most likely to adversely affect the Group's and 
Company's available financial resources over 
this period were: 

■■ availability of funding and liquidity in the 
event of a market wide stress scenario 
including the impact of the manner in 
which the UK withdraws from the 
European Union; and

■■ impact on regulatory capital requirements 
in the event of an economic slowdown 
or recession.

As these were risks that could potentially cast 
significant doubt on the Group's and the 
Company's ability to continue as a going 
concern, we considered sensitivities over the 
level of available financial resources indicated 
by the Group's financial forecasts taking 
account of reasonably possible (but not 
unrealistic) adverse effects that could arise 
from these risks individually and collectively 
and evaluated the achievability of the actions 

the Directors consider they would take to 
improve the position should the risks 
materialise.

Based on this work, we are required to report 
to you if:

■■ we have anything material to add or draw 
attention to in relation to the Directors' 
statement in Note 1 to the financial 
statements on the use of the going 
concern basis of accounting with no 
material uncertainties that may cast 
significant doubt over the Group and 
Company's use of that basis for a period of 
at least twelve months from the date of 
approval of the financial statements; or

■■ the related statement under the Listing 
Rules is materially inconsistent with our 
audit knowledge.

We have nothing to report in these respects, 
and we did not identify going concern as a key 
audit matter.

5 We have nothing to report on 
the other information in the 
Annual Report
The Directors are responsible for the other 
information presented in the Annual Report 
together with the financial statements. Our 
opinion on the financial statements does not 
cover the other information and, accordingly, 
we do not express an audit opinion or, except 
as explicitly stated below, any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon. 

Our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider 
whether, based on our financial statements 
audit work, the information therein is 
materially misstated or inconsistent with the 
financial statements or our audit knowledge. 
Based solely on that work we have not 
identified material misstatements in the other 
information. 

Strategic report and Directors' report 
Based solely on our work on the other 
information: 

■■ we have not identified material 
misstatements in the strategic report and 
the Directors' report;

■■ in our opinion the information given in 
those reports for the financial year is 
consistent with the financial statements; 
and 

■■ in our opinion those reports have been 
prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006. 

Directors' remuneration report 
In our opinion the part of the Directors' 
Remuneration Report to be audited has been 
properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006. 

Disclosures of emerging and principal 
risks and longer-term viability 
Based on the knowledge we acquired during 
our financial statements audit, we have 
nothing material to add or draw attention 
to in relation to: 

■■ the Directors' confirmation within the 
Viability Statement (page 41) that they 
have carried out a robust assessment of 
the emerging and principal risks facing the 
Group, including those that would threaten 
its business model, future performance, 
solvency and liquidity; 

■■ the material and emerging risks disclosures 
describing these risks within the Viability 
Statement and explaining how they are 
being managed and mitigated; and 

■■ the Directors' explanation in the Viability 
Statement of how they have assessed the 
prospects of the Group, over what period 
they have done so and why they 
considered that period to be appropriate, 
and their statement as to whether they 
have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group will be able to continue in operation 
and meet its liabilities as they fall due over 
the period of their assessment, including 
any related disclosures drawing attention 
to any necessary qualifications or 
assumptions. 

Under the Listing Rules we are required to 
review the Viability Statement. We have 
nothing to report in this respect. 

Our work is limited to assessing these matters 
in the context of only the knowledge acquired 
during our financial statements audit. As we 
cannot predict all future events or conditions 
and as subsequent events may result in 
outcomes that are inconsistent with 
judgements that were reasonable at the time 
they were made, the absence of anything to 
report on these statements is not a guarantee 
as to the Group's and Company's longer-term 
viability.

Corporate governance disclosures 
We are required to report to you if: 

■■ we have identified material inconsistencies 
between the knowledge we acquired 
during our financial statements audit and 
the Directors' statement that they consider 
that the annual report and financial 
statements taken as a whole is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Group's position and 
performance, business model and strategy; 
or 

■■ the section of the annual report describing 
the work of the Audit Committee does not 
appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit 
Committee.

detail in respect of legal, competition and 
regulatory matters is set out in the key audit 
matters disclosures in section 2 of this report.

Owing to the inherent limitations of an audit, 
there is an unavoidable risk that we may not 
have detected some material misstatements 
in the financial statements, even though we 
have properly planned and performed our 
audit in accordance with auditing standards. 
For example, the further removed non-
compliance with laws and regulations 
(irregularities) is from the events and 
transactions reflected in the financial 
statements, the less likely the inherently 
limited procedures required by auditing 
standards would identify it. In addition, as 
with any audit, there remained a higher risk of 
non-detection of irregularities, as these may 
involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override 
of internal controls. We are not responsible for 
preventing non-compliance and cannot be 
expected to detect non-compliance with all 
laws and regulations.

8 The purpose of our audit work 
and to whom we owe our 
responsibilities 
This report is made solely to the Parent 
company's members, as a body, in accordance 
with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006. Our audit work has been 
undertaken so that we might state to the 
Parent company's members those matters we 
are required to state to them in an auditor's 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest 
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than 
the Parent company and the Parent 
company's members, as a body, for our audit 
work, for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed.

irregularities or error and are considered 
material if, individually or in aggregate, they 
could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the 
basis of the financial statements. 

A fuller description of our responsibilities is 
provided on the FRC's website at www.frc.
org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. 

Irregularities – ability to detect
We identified areas of laws and regulations 
that could reasonably be expected to have a 
material effect on the financial statements 
from our general commercial and sector 
experience through discussion with the 
Directors and other management (as required 
by auditing standards), and from inspection of 
the Group's regulatory and legal 
correspondence and discussed with the 
Directors and other management the policies 
and procedures regarding compliance with 
laws and regulations. We communicated 
identified laws and regulations throughout our 
team and remained alert to any indications of 
non-compliance throughout the audit. This 
included communication from the Group 
team to component audit teams of relevant 
laws and regulations identified at the Group 
level.

The potential effect of these laws and 
regulations on the financial statements varies 
considerably.

Firstly, the Group is subject to laws and 
regulations that directly affect the financial 
statements including financial reporting 
legislation (including related companies 
legislation), distributable profits legislation 
and taxation legislation, and we assessed the 
extent of compliance with these laws and 
regulations as part of our procedures on the 
related financial statement items. 

Secondly the Group is subject to many other 
laws and regulations where the consequences 
of non-compliance could have a material 
effect on amounts or disclosures in the 
financial statements, for instance through the 
imposition of fines or litigation, or the loss of 
the Group's license to operate. We identified 
the following areas as those most likely to 
have such an effect: specific aspects of 
regulatory capital and liquidity, conduct 
including PPI mis-selling, money laundering, 
sanctions list and financial crime, market 
abuse regulations and certain aspects of 
company legislation recognising the financial 
and regulated nature of the Group's activities. 
Auditing standards limit the required audit 
procedures to identify non-compliance with 
these laws and regulations to enquiry of the 
Directors and other management and 
inspection of regulatory and legal 
correspondence, if any. Through these 
procedures, we became aware of actual or 
suspected non-compliance and considered 
the effect as part of our procedures on the 
related financial statement items. Further 

We are required to report to you if the 
Corporate Governance Statement does not 
properly disclose a departure from the 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code specified by the Listing Rules for our 
review. 

We have nothing to report in these respects. 

6 We have nothing to report on 
the other matters on which we 
are required to report by 
exception 
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion: 

■■ adequate accounting records have not 
been kept by the Parent company, or 
returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited by 
us; or 

■■ the Parent company financial statements 
and the part of the Directors' 
Remuneration Report to be audited are not 
in agreement with the accounting records 
and returns; or 

■■ certain disclosures of Directors' 
remuneration specified by law are not 
made; or 

■■ we have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for our audit. 

We have nothing to report in these respects. 

7 Respective responsibilities 
Directors' responsibilities 
As explained more fully in their Directors' 
responsibilities statement set out on page 84, 
the Directors are responsible for: the 
preparation of the financial statements 
including being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view; such internal control as they 
determine is necessary to enable the 
preparation of financial statements that are 
free from material misstatement, whether due 
to fraud or error; assessing the Group and 
Parent company's ability to continue as a 
going concern, disclosing, as applicable, 
matters related to going concern; and using 
the going concern basis of accounting unless 
they either intend to liquidate the Group or 
the Parent company or to cease operations, or 
have no realistic alternative but to do so. 

Auditor's responsibilities 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the financial 
statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or other 
irregularities (see below), or error, and to issue 
our opinion in an auditor's report. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but 
does not guarantee that an audit conducted in 
accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect 
a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud, other

Notes
a For further details refer to Note 28.
b For further details refer to Note 29.
c Effects of changes in accounting policy relate to the adoption of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers on 1 January 2018. The impact of 

IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers was an increase to retained earnings of £67m with the remainder due to the impact of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments.
d From 2019, due to an IAS 12 update, the tax relief on payments in relation to equity instruments has been recognised in the tax charge of the income statement, whereas it was 

previously recorded in retained earnings. Comparatives have been restated, increasing profit after tax by £211m. Further detail can be found in Note 1.
e Following a review of subordinated liabilities issued by Barclays Bank PLC, certain instruments deemed to have characteristics that qualify them as equity have been reclassified.

248 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2019 home.barclays/annualreport

This section describes the Group's significant policies and critical accounting estimates that relate to the financial statements and notes as a 
whole. If an accounting policy or a critical accounting estimate relates to a particular note, the accounting policy and/or critical accounting 
estimate is contained with the relevant note.

1 Significant accounting policies

1. Reporting entity
These financial statements are prepared for Barclays PLC and its subsidiaries (the Group) under Section 399 of the Companies Act 2006. The 
Group is a major global financial services provider engaged in retail banking, credit cards, wholesale banking, investment banking, wealth 
management and investment management services. In addition, separate financial statements have been presented for the holding company.

2. Compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards
The consolidated financial statements of the Group, and the separate financial statements of Barclays PLC, have been prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and interpretations (IFRICs) issued by the Interpretations Committee, as published by 
the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). They are also in accordance with IFRS and IFRIC interpretations endorsed by the 
European Union. The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated and separate financial statements are set out 
below, and in the relevant notes to the financial statements. These policies have been consistently applied with the exception of the adoption 
of IFRS 16 Leases, IFRIC Interpretation 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments, the amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes, the amendments 
to IAS 19 Employee Benefits, and the amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 which were applied from 1 January 2019.

3. Basis of preparation
The consolidated and separate financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention modified to include the fair 
valuation of investment property, and particular financial instruments, to the extent required or permitted under IFRS as set out in the relevant 
accounting policies. They are stated in millions of pounds Sterling (£m), the functional currency of Barclays PLC.

The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to 
companies using IFRS.

4. Accounting policies
The Group prepares financial statements in accordance with IFRS. The Group's significant accounting policies relating to specific financial 
statement items, together with a description of the accounting estimates and judgements that were critical to preparing them, are set out 
under the relevant notes. Accounting policies that affect the financial statements as a whole are set out below.

(i) Consolidation
The Group applies IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements.

The consolidated financial statements combine the financial statements of Barclays PLC and all its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are entities over 
which Barclays PLC has control. The Group has control over another entity when the Group has all of the following:

1) power over the relevant activities of the investee, for example through voting or other rights

2) exposure to, or rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee, and

3) the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.

The assessment of control is based on the consideration of all facts and circumstances. The Group reassesses whether it controls an investee 
if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control.

Intra-group transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation. Consistent accounting policies are used throughout the Group for the 
purposes of the consolidation.

Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions if they occur after control has already been obtained 
and they do not result in loss of control.

As the consolidated financial statements include partnerships where the Group member is a partner, advantage has been taken of the exemption 
under Regulation 7 of the Partnership (Accounts) Regulations 2008 with regard to preparing and filing of individual partnership financial statements.

Details of the principal subsidiaries are given in Note 34, and a complete list of all subsidiaries is presented in Note 43.

(ii) Foreign currency translation
The Group applies IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at 
the rate ruling on the date of the transaction. Foreign currency monetary balances are translated into Sterling at the period end exchange rates. 
Exchange gains and losses on such balances are taken to the income statement. Non-monetary foreign currency balances are carried at 
historical transaction date exchange rates.

The Group's foreign operations (including subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and branches) based mainly outside the UK may have 
different functional currencies. The functional currency of an operation is the currency of the main economy to which it is exposed.

1 Significant accounting policies continued

Prior to consolidation (or equity accounting) the assets and liabilities of non-Sterling operations are translated at the period end exchange rate 
and items of income, expense and other comprehensive income are translated into Sterling at the rate on the date of the transactions. 
Exchange differences arising on the translation of foreign operations are included in currency translation reserves within equity. These are 
transferred to the income statement when the Group disposes of the entire interest in a foreign operation, when partial disposal results in the 
loss of control of an interest in a subsidiary, when an investment previously accounted for using the equity method is accounted for as a 
financial asset, or on the disposal of an autonomous foreign operation within a branch.

(iii) Financial assets and liabilities
The Group applies IFRS 9 Financial Instruments to the recognition, classification and measurement, and derecognition of financial assets 
and financial liabilities and the impairment of financial assets. The Group applies the requirements of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition 
and Measurement for hedge accounting purposes.

Recognition
The Group recognises financial assets and liabilities when it becomes a party to the terms of the contract. Trade date or settlement date 
accounting is applied depending on the classification of the financial asset.

Classification and measurement
Financial assets are classified on the basis of two criteria: 

i) the business model within which financial assets are managed, and 

ii) their contractual cash flow characteristics (whether the cash flows represent ‘solely payments of principal and interest' (SPPI)).

The Group assesses the business model criteria at a portfolio level. Information that is considered in determining the applicable business model 
includes (i) policies and objectives for the relevant portfolio, (ii) how the performance and risks of the portfolio are managed, evaluated and 
reported to management, and (iii) the frequency, volume and timing of sales in prior periods, sales expectation for future periods, and the 
reasons for such sales.

The contractual cash flow characteristics of financial assets are assessed with reference to whether the cash flows represent SPPI. In assessing 
whether contractual cash flows are SPPI compliant, interest is defined as consideration primarily for the time value of money and the credit risk 
of the principal outstanding. The time value of money is defined as the element of interest that provides consideration only for the passage of 
time and not consideration for other risks or costs associated with holding the financial asset. Terms that could change the contractual cash 
flows so that it would not meet the condition for SPPI are considered, including: (i) contingent and leverage features, (ii) non-recourse 
arrangements and (iii) features that could modify the time value of money.

Financial assets are measured at amortised cost if they are held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order 
to collect contractual cash flows, and their contractual cash flows represent SPPI.

Financial assets are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if they are held within a business model whose objective 
is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets, and their contractual cash flows represent SPPI.

Other financial assets are measured at fair value through profit and loss. There is an option to make an irrevocable election on initial 
recognition for non traded equity investments to be measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, in which case dividends are 
recognised in profit or loss, but gains or losses are not reclassified to profit or loss upon derecognition, and the impairment requirements 
of IFRS 9 do not apply.

The accounting policy for each type of financial asset or liability is included within the relevant note for the item. The Group's policies for 
determining the fair values of the assets and liabilities are set out in Note 17.

Derecognition
The Group derecognises a financial asset, or a portion of a financial asset, from its balance sheet where the contractual rights to cash flows 
from the asset have expired, or have been transferred, usually by sale, and with them either substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset 
or significant risks and rewards, along with the unconditional ability to sell or pledge the asset.

Financial liabilities are derecognised when the liability has been settled, has expired or has been extinguished. An exchange of an existing 
financial liability for a new liability with the same lender on substantially different terms – generally a difference of 10% or more in the present 
value of the cash flows or a substantive qualitative amendment – is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the 
recognition of a new financial liability.

Transactions in which the Group transfers assets and liabilities, portions of them, or financial risks associated with them can be complex and 
it may not be obvious whether substantially all of the risks and rewards have been transferred. It is often necessary to perform a quantitative 
analysis. Such an analysis compares the Group's exposure to variability in asset cash flows before the transfer with its retained exposure after 
the transfer.

A cash flow analysis of this nature may require judgement. In particular, it is necessary to estimate the asset's expected future cash flows as 
well as potential variability around this expectation. The method of estimating expected future cash flows depends on the nature of the asset, 
with market and market-implied data used to the greatest extent possible. The potential variability around this expectation is typically 
determined by stressing underlying parameters to create reasonable alternative upside and downside scenarios. Probabilities are then assigned 
to each scenario. Stressed parameters may include default rates, loss severity, or prepayment rates.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

for the year ended 31 December 2019

1 Significant accounting policies continued

Accounting for reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements including other similar lending and borrowing
Reverse repurchase agreements (and stock borrowing or similar transaction) are a form of secured lending whereby the Group provides a loan 
or cash collateral in exchange for the transfer of collateral, generally in the form of marketable securities subject to an agreement to transfer 
the securities back at a fixed price in the future. Repurchase agreements are where the Group obtains such loans or cash collateral, in exchange 
for the transfer of collateral.

The Group purchases (a reverse repurchase agreement) or borrows securities subject to a commitment to resell or return them. The securities 
are not included in the balance sheet as the Group does not acquire the risks and rewards of ownership. Consideration paid (or cash collateral 
provided) is accounted for as a loan asset at amortised cost, unless it is designated or mandatorily at fair value through profit and loss. 

The Group may also sell (a repurchase agreement) or lend securities subject to a commitment to repurchase or redeem them. The securities 
are retained on the balance sheet as the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. Consideration received (or cash 
collateral provided) is accounted for as a financial liability at amortised cost, unless it is designated at fair value through profit and loss.

(iv) Issued debt and equity instruments
The Group applies IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation, to determine whether funding is either a financial liability (debt) or equity.

Issued financial instruments or their components are classified as liabilities if the contractual arrangement results in the Group having an 
obligation to either deliver cash or another financial asset, or a variable number of equity shares, to the holder of the instrument. If this is not 
the case, the instrument is generally an equity instrument and the proceeds included in equity, net of transaction costs. Dividends and other 
returns to equity holders are recognised when paid or declared by the members at the AGM and treated as a deduction from equity.

Where issued financial instruments contain both liability and equity components, these are accounted for separately. The fair value of the debt 
is estimated first and the balance of the proceeds is included within equity.

5. New and amended standards and interpretations 
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year, with the exception of the adoption of IFRS 16 Leases, 
IFRIC Interpretation 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatment, the amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes, the amendments to IAS 19 Employee 
Benefits, and the amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 which were applied from 1 January 2019.

IFRS 16 – Leases
IFRS 16 Leases, which replaced IAS 17 Leases, does not result in a significant change to lessor accounting; however, for lessee accounting there 
is no longer a distinction between operating and finance leases. Instead, the lessee is required to recognise both a right of use (ROU) asset and 
lease liability on-balance sheet. There is a recognition exemption permitted for leases with a term of 12 months or less. 

The Group applied IFRS 16 on a modified retrospective basis and took advantage of the option not to restate comparative periods. The Group 
applied the following transition options available under the modified retrospective approach:

■■ to calculate the right of use asset equal to the lease liability, adjusted for prepaid or accrued payments
■■ to rely on the previous assessment of whether leases are onerous in accordance with IAS 37 immediately before the date of initial 

application as an alternative to performing an impairment review. The Group adjusted the carrying amount of the ROU asset at the date 
of initial application by the previous carrying amount of its onerous lease provision

■■ to apply the recognition exception for leases with a term not exceeding 12 months
■■ to use hindsight in determining the lease term if the contract contains options to extend or terminate the lease.

Upon adoption of IFRS 16, the Group applied the transition option which permitted the ROU asset to equal the lease liability, adjusted 
for prepaid or accrued prepayments. This approach resulted in a lease liability of £1,696m and an ROU asset of £1,644m being recognised 
as at 1 January 2019. The difference in the lease liability and the ROU asset was a result of the following adjustments:

■■ an increase in the ROU asset as a result of rental prepayments of £55m, and
■■ a decrease in the ROU asset as a result of onerous lease provisions previously recognised of £64m, £40m of rent free adjustments and £3m 

of finance sublease arrangements.

The ROU asset was recorded in property, plant and equipment and the lease liability within other liabilities. 

When measuring lease liabilities, the Group discounted lease payments using the incremental borrowing rate at 1 January 2019. The weighted 
average applied was 4.57%.

IFRIC Interpretation 23 – Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatment
IFRIC 23 clarifies the application of IAS 12 to accounting for income tax treatments that have yet to be accepted by tax authorities, in scenarios 
where it may be unclear how tax law applies to a particular transaction or circumstance, or whether a taxation authority will accept an entity's 
tax treatment. There was no significant effect from the adoption of IFRIC 23 in relation to accounting for uncertain tax positions.

IAS 12 – Income Taxes – Amendments to IAS 12
The IASB amended IAS 12 in order to clarify the accounting treatment of the income tax consequences of dividends. As a result of the 
amendment, the tax consequences of all payments on financial instruments that are classified as equity for accounting purposes, where those 
payments are considered to be a distribution of profit, will be included in, and will reduce, the income statement tax charge. The amendments 
of IAS 12 were applied to the income tax consequences of dividends recognised on or after the beginning of the earliest comparative period. 
This resulted in reducing the tax charge and increasing profit after tax for 2019 by £222m, 2018 by £211m and 2017 by £174m. This change 
does not impact retained earnings or earnings per share.

IAS 19 – Employee Benefits – Amendments to IAS 19
The IASB issued amendments to the guidance in IAS 19 Employee Benefits, in connection with accounting for plan amendments, curtailments 
and settlements. There was no significant effect from the adoption of the amendments to IAS 19.

IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 – Amendments relating to Interest Rate Benchmark Reform
IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 were amended in September 2019. The amendments are effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020 
with earlier application permitted. The Group elected to early adopt the amendments with effect from 1 January 2019. The amendments have 
been endorsed by the EU.

IFRS 9 allows companies when they first apply IFRS 9, to choose as an accounting policy to continue to apply the hedge accounting 
requirements of IAS 39. The Group made the election to continue to apply the IAS 39 hedge accounting requirements, and consequently, 
the amendments to IAS 39 have been adopted by the Group.

The objective of the amendments are to provide temporary exceptions from applying specific hedge accounting requirements during the 
period of uncertainty resulting from interest rate benchmark reform. Each of the exceptions adopted by the Group are described below.

■■ Highly probable requirement 
When determining whether a forecast transaction or cash flow is highly probable, the Group assumes that the interest rate benchmark 
on which the hedged cash flows are based is not altered as a result of the reform. This amendment has also been applied when cash flows 
are still expected to occur in respect of amounts remaining in the cash flow hedge reserve.

■■ Prospective assessments 
When performing prospective assessments, the Group assumes that the interest rate benchmark on which the hedged risk and/or hedging 
instrument are based is not altered as a result of the interest rate benchmark reform.

■■ Retrospective assessments 
The Group will not discontinue hedge accounting during the period of IBOR-related uncertainty solely because the retrospective 
effectiveness falls outside the required 80-125% range.

■■ Hedge of a non-contractually specified benchmark portion of an interest rate 
The Group only considers at inception of such a hedging relationship whether the separately identifiable requirement is met.

The amendments to IFRS 7 require certain disclosures to be made in the first period that the amendments to IFRS 9 or IAS 39 are adopted. 
Refer to Note 14 where these disclosures have been included.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1 Significant accounting policies continued

IFRS 17 – Insurance contracts
In May 2017, the IASB issued IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts, a comprehensive new accounting standard for insurance contracts covering recognition 
and measurement, presentation and disclosure. Once effective, IFRS 17 will replace IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts that was issued in 2005.

IFRS 17 applies to all types of insurance contracts (i.e. life, non-life, direct insurance and reinsurance), regardless of the type of entities that issue 
them, as well as to certain guarantees and financial instruments with discretionary participation features. A few scope exceptions will apply. 

In June 2019, the IASB published an exposure draft with proposed amendments to IFRS 17. The proposed amendments that are expected to be 
relevant to the Group are changes to the scoping of IFRS 17, changes in the effective date of IFRS 17 and changes to IFRS 9 which were 
consequential amendments as a result of IFRS 17.

The standard is currently effective from 1 January 2021, although the amendments would change the effective date to 1 January 2022, and the 
standard has not yet been endorsed by the EU. The Group is currently assessing the expected impact of adopting this standard.

6. Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of estimates. It also requires management to exercise 
judgement in applying the accounting policies. The key areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where 
assumptions are significant to the consolidated and individual financial statements are highlighted under the relevant note. Critical accounting 
estimates and judgements are disclosed in:

■■ Credit impairment charges on page 259
■■ Tax on page 264
■■ Fair value of financial instruments on page 279
■■ Pensions and post-retirement benefits – obligations on page 316
■■ Provisions including conduct and legal, competition and regulatory matters on page 303.

7. Other disclosures
To improve transparency and ease of reference, by concentrating related information in one place, certain disclosures required under IFRS have 
been included within the Risk review section as follows:

■■ Credit risk on pages 139 to 140 and 148 to 175
■■ Market risk on pages 141 and 176 to 177
■■ Treasury and capital risk – liquidity on pages 142 and 178 to 189
■■ Treasury and capital risk – capital on pages 142 and 190 to 199.

These disclosures are covered by the Audit opinion (included on pages 232 to 240) where referenced as audited.

statement commentary within Financial review (unaudited) on page 215.

2 Segmental reporting

Presentation of segmental reporting
The Group's segmental reporting is in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments. Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent 
with the internal reporting provided to the Executive Committee, which is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance 
of the operating segments, and has been identified as the chief operating decision maker. All transactions between business segments are 
conducted on an arm's-length basis, with intra-segment revenue and costs being eliminated in Head Office. Income and expenses directly 
associated with each segment are included in determining business segment performance.

The Group is a British universal bank and for segmental reporting purposes it defines its two operating divisions as Barclays UK and Barclays 
International.

■■ Barclays UK which meets the banking needs of UK based retail customers and small to medium sized enterprises, through offering products 
and services. The division includes the UK Personal banking, UK Business banking and the Barclaycard consumer UK businesses.

■■ Barclays International which delivers products and services designed for our larger corporate, wholesale and international banking clients. 
The division includes the large UK Corporate business; the international Corporate and Private Bank businesses; the Investment Bank; the 
international Barclaycard business; and Payments.

The table below also includes Head Office which comprises head office, Barclays Execution Services FTE and legacy businesses.

3 Net interest income

Accounting for interest income and expenses
Interest income on loans and advances at amortised cost, and interest expense on financial liabilities held at amortised cost, are calculated 
using the effective interest method which allocates interest, and direct and incremental fees and costs, over the expected lives of the assets 
and liabilities.

The effective interest method requires the Group to estimate future cash flows, in some cases based on its experience of customers' behaviour, 
considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, as well as the expected lives of the assets and liabilities. 

The Group incurs certain costs to originate credit card balances with the most significant being co-brand partner fees. To the extent these costs 
are attributed to customers that continuously carry an outstanding balance (revolvers), they are capitalised and subsequently included within 
the calculation of the effective interest rate. They are amortised to interest income over the period of expected repayment of the originated 
balance. Costs attributed to customers that settle their outstanding balances each period (transactors) are deferred on the balance sheet as a 
cost of obtaining a contract and amortised to fee and commission expense over the life of the customer relationship (refer to Note 4). There are 
no other individual estimates involved in the calculation of effective interest rates that are material to the results or financial position.

Interest income presented above represents interest revenue calculated using the effective interest method. Costs to originate credit card balances 
of £697m (2018: £596m; 2017: £497m) have been amortised to interest income during the year. Interest income includes £48m (2018: £53m; 
2017: £48m) accrued on impaired loans. Other interest expense includes £76m relating to IFRS 16 lease interest expenses.

4 Net fee and commission income

Accounting for net fee and commission income under IFRS 15 effective from 1 January 2018
The Group applies IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The standard establishes a five-step model governing revenue recognition. 
The five-step model requires the Group to (i) identify the contract with the customer, (ii) identify each of the performance obligations included 
in the contract, (iii) determine the amount of consideration in the contract, (iv) allocate the consideration to each of the identified performance 
obligations and (v) recognise revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied.

The Group recognises fee and commission income charged for services provided by the Group as the services are provided, for example 
on completion of the underlying transaction.

Accounting for net fee and commission income under IAS 18 for 2017
The Group applies IAS 18 Revenue. Fees and commissions charged for services provided or received by the Group are recognised as the 
services are provided, for example on completion of the underlying transaction.

Fee and commission income is disaggregated below by fee types that reflect the nature of the services offered across the Group and operating 
segments, in accordance with IFRS 15. It includes a total for fees in scope of IFRS 15. Refer to Note 2 for more detailed information about 
operating segments.

Fee types
Transactional
Transactional fees are service charges on deposit accounts, cash management services and transactional processing fees including interchange 
and merchant fee income generated from credit and bank card usage. Transaction and processing fees are recognised at the point in time the 
transaction occurs or service is performed. They include banking services such as Automated Teller Machine (ATM) fees, wire transfer fees, 
balance transfer fees, overdraft or late fees and foreign exchange fees, among others. Interchange and merchant fees are recognised upon 
settlement of the card transaction payment.

Barclays incurs certain card related costs including those related to cardholder reward programmes and various payments made to co-brand 
partners. To the extent cardholder reward programmes costs are attributed to customers that settle their outstanding balance each period 
(transactors) they are expensed when incurred and presented in fee and commission expense while costs related to customers who continuously 
carry an outstanding balance (revolvers) are included in the effective interest rate of the receivable (refer to Note 3). Payments to partners for new 
cardholder account originations for transactor accounts are deferred as costs to obtain a contract under IFRS 15 while those costs related to 
revolver accounts are included in the effective interest rate of the receivable (refer to Note 3). Those costs deferred under IFRS 15 are capitalised 
and amortised over the estimated cardholder relationship. Payments to co-brand partners based on revenue sharing are presented as a reduction 
of fee and commission income while payments based on profitability are presented in fee and commission expense.

4 Net fee and commission income continued
Advisory
Advisory fees are generated from wealth management services and investment banking advisory services related to mergers, acquisitions and 
financial restructurings. Wealth management advisory fees primarily consists of asset-based fees for advisory accounts of wealth management 
clients and are based on the market value of client assets. They are earned over the period the services are provided and are generally recognised 
quarterly when the market value of client assets is determined. Investment banking advisory fees are recognised at the point in time when the 
services related to the transaction have been completed under the terms of the engagement. Investment banking advisory costs are recognised 
as incurred in fee and commission expense if direct and incremental to the advisory services or otherwise recognised in operating expenses.

Brokerage and execution
Brokerage and execution fees are earned for executing client transactions with various exchanges and over the counter markets and assisting 
clients in clearing transactions. Brokerage and execution fees are recognised at the point in time the associated service has been completed which 
is generally the trade date of the transaction.

Underwriting and syndication
Underwriting and syndication fees are earned for the distribution of client equity or debt securities and the arrangement and administration 
of a loan syndication. This includes commitment fees to provide loan financing. Underwriting fees are generally recognised on trade date if there 
is no remaining contingency, such as the transaction being conditional on the closing of an acquisition or another transaction. Underwriting costs 
are deferred and recognised in fee and commission expense when the associated underwriting fees are recorded. Syndication fees are earned 
for arranging and administering a loan syndication; however, the associated fee may be subject to variability until the loan has been syndicated 
to other syndicate members or until other contingencies (such as a successful M&A closing) have been resolved and therefore the fee revenue 
is deferred until the uncertainty is resolved.

Included in the underwriting and syndication, are commitment fees to provide loan financing includes fees which are not presented as part of the 
carrying value of the loan in accordance with IFRS 9, for example as part of the effective interest rate. Loan commitment fees included as IFRS 15 
revenues are fees for loan commitments that are not expected to fund, fees received as compensation for unfunded commitments and the 
applicable portion of fees received for a revolving loan facility, which for that period, are undrawn. Such commitment fees are recognised over time 
through to the contractual maturity of the commitment.

Contract assets and contract liabilities
The Group had no material contract assets or contract liabilities as at 31 December 2019 (2018: nil).

Impairment on fee receivables and contract assets
During 2019, there have been no material impairments recognised in relation to fees receivable and contract assets (2018: nil). Fees in relation 
to transactional business can be added to outstanding customer balances. These amounts may be subsequently impaired as part of the overall 
loans and advances balance.

Remaining performance obligations
The Group applies the practical expedient of IFRS 15 and does not disclose information about remaining performance obligations that have 
original expected durations of one year or less or because the Group has a right to consideration that corresponds directly with the value of the 
service provided to the client or customer.

Costs incurred in obtaining or fulfilling a contract
The Group expects that incremental costs of obtaining a contract such as success fee and commission fees paid are recoverable and therefore 
capitalised such contract costs in the amount of £159m at 31 December 2019 (2018: £125m).

Capitalised contract costs are amortised based on the transfer of services to which the asset relates which typically ranges over the expected life 
of the relationship. In 2019, the amount of amortisation was £30m (2018: £30m) and there was no impairment loss recognised in connection with 
the capitalised contract costs (2018: nil).

5 Net trading income

Accounting for net trading income
In accordance with IFRS 9, trading positions are held at fair value, and the resulting gains and losses are included in the income statement, 
together with interest and dividends arising from long and short positions and funding costs relating to trading activities.

Income arises from both the sale and purchase of trading positions, margins which are achieved through market making and customer 
business and from changes in fair value caused by movements in interest and exchange rates, equity prices and other market variables.

Gains or losses on non-trading financial instruments designated or mandatorily at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the income 
statement are included in net trading income where the business model is to manage assets and liabilities on a fair value basis which includes 
use of derivatives or where an instrument is designated at fair value to eliminate an accounting mismatch and the related instrument's gain 
and losses are reported in trading income.

7 Credit impairment charges

Accounting for the impairment of financial assets under IFRS 9 effective from 1 January 2018
Impairment 
The Group is required to recognise expected credit losses (ECLs) based on unbiased forward-looking information for all financial assets at 
amortised cost, lease receivables, debt financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, loan commitments and financial 
guarantee contracts. 

At the reporting date, an allowance (or provision for loan commitments and financial guarantees) is required for the 12 month (Stage 1) ECLs. 
If the credit risk has significantly increased since initial recognition (Stage 2), or if the financial instrument is credit impaired (Stage 3), an 
allowance (or provision) should be recognised for the lifetime ECLs. 

The measurement of ECL is calculated using three main components: (i) probability of default (PD) (ii) loss given default (LGD) and (iii) the 
exposure at default (EAD). 

The 12 month and lifetime ECLs are calculated by multiplying the respective PD, LGD and the EAD. The 12 month and lifetime PDs represent 
the PD occurring over the next 12 months and the remaining maturity of the instrument respectively. The EAD represents the expected balance 
at default, taking into account the repayment of principal and interest from the balance sheet date to the default event together with any 
expected drawdowns of committed facilities. The LGD represents expected losses on the EAD given the event of default, taking into account, 
among other attributes, the mitigating effect of collateral value at the time it is expected to be realised and the time value of money. 

Determining a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition:

The Group assesses when a significant increase in credit risk has occurred based on quantitative and qualitative assessments. The credit risk 
of an exposure is considered to have significantly increased when:

i) Quantitative test
The annualised lifetime PD has increased by more than an agreed threshold relative to the equivalent at origination.

PD deterioration thresholds are defined as percentage increases, and are set at an origination score band and segment level to ensure the test 
appropriately captures significant increases in credit risk at all risk levels. Generally, thresholds are inversely correlated to the origination PD, 
i.e. as the origination PD increases, the threshold value reduces.

The assessment of the point at which a PD increase is deemed ‘significant', is based upon analysis of the portfolios' risk profile against 
a common set of principles and performance metrics (consistent across both retail and wholesale businesses), incorporating expert credit 
judgement where appropriate. Application of quantitative PD floors does not represent the use of the low credit risk exemption as exposures 
can separately move into Stage 2 via the qualitative route described below. 

Wholesale assets apply a 100% increase in PD and 0.2% PD floor to determine a significant increase in credit risk.

Retail assets apply bespoke relative increase and absolute PD thresholds based on product type and origination PD. Thresholds are subject 
to maximums defined by Group policy and typically apply minimum relative thresholds of 50-100% and a maximum relative threshold of 400%. 

For existing/historical exposures where origination point scores or data are no longer available or do not represent a comparable estimate 
of lifetime PD, a proxy origination score is defined, based upon: 

■■ back-population of the approved lifetime PD score either to origination date or, where this is not feasible, as far back as possible (subject 
to a data start point no later than 1 January 2015), or

■■ use of available historical account performance data and other customer information, to derive a comparable ‘proxy' estimation of origination PD.

ii) Qualitative test
This is relevant for accounts that meet the portfolio's ‘high risk' criteria and are subject to closer credit monitoring.

High risk customers may not be in arrears but either through an event or an observed behaviour exhibit credit distress. The definition and 
assessment of high risk includes as wide a range of information as reasonably available, such as industry and Group-wide customer level data, 
including but not limited to bureau scores and high consumer indebtedness index, wherever possible or relevant.

Whilst the high risk populations applied for IFRS 9 impairment purposes are aligned with risk management processes, they are also regularly 
reviewed and validated to ensure that they capture any incremental segments where there is evidence of credit deterioration.

iii) Backstop criteria
This is relevant for accounts that are more than 30 calendar days past due. The 30 days past due criteria is a backstop rather than a primary 
driver of moving exposures into Stage 2.

The criteria for determining a significant increase in credit risk for assets with bullet repayments follows the same principle as all other assets, 
i.e. quantitative, qualitative and backstop tests are all applied.

Exposures will move back to Stage 1 once they no longer meet the criteria for a significant increase in credit risk. This means that, at a 
minimum all payments must be up-to-date, the PD deterioration test is no longer met, the account is no longer classified as high risk, and the 
customer has evidenced an ability to maintain future payments.

Performance/return

7 Credit impairment charges continued

Exposures are only removed from Stage 3 and re-assigned to Stage 2 once the original default trigger event no longer applies. Exposures being 
removed from Stage 3 must no longer qualify as credit impaired, and:

a) the obligor will also have demonstrated consistently good payment behaviour over a 12-month period, by making all consecutive 
contractual payments due and, for forborne exposures, the relevant EBA defined probationary period has also been successfully completed or;

b) (for non-forborne exposures) the performance conditions are defined and approved within an appropriately sanctioned restructure plan, 
including 12 months' payment history have been met.

Management overlays and other exceptions to model outputs are applied only if consistent with the objective of identifying significant 
increases in credit risk.

Forward-looking information
The measurement of ECL involves complexity and judgement, including estimation of PD, LGD, a range of unbiased future economic scenarios, 
estimation of expected lives (where contractual life is not appropriate), and estimation of EAD and assessing significant increases in credit risk.

Credit losses are the expected cash shortfalls from what is contractually due over the expected life of the financial instrument, discounted at 
the original effective interest rate (EIR). ECLs are the unbiased probability-weighted credit losses determined by evaluating a range of possible 
outcomes and considering future economic conditions.

The Group uses a five-scenario model to calculate ECL. An external consensus forecast is assembled from key sources, including HM Treasury 
(short and medium term forecasts), Bloomberg (based on median of economic forecasts) and the Urban Land Institute (for US House Prices), 
which forms the baseline scenario. In addition, two adverse scenarios (Downside 1 and Downside 2) and two favourable scenarios (Upside 1 
and Upside 2) are derived, with associated probability weightings. The adverse scenarios are calibrated to a similar severity to internal stress 
tests, whilst also considering IFRS 9 specific sensitivities and non-linearity. Downside 2 is benchmarked to the Bank of England's annual cyclical 
scenarios and to the most severe scenario from Moody's inventory, but is not designed to be the same. The favourable scenarios are calibrated 
to be symmetric to the adverse scenarios, subject to a ceiling calibrated to relevant recent favourable benchmark scenarios. The scenarios 
include eight economic variables, (GDP, unemployment, House Price Index (HPI) and base rates in both the UK and US markets), and expanded 
variables using statistical models based on historical correlations. The upside and downside shocks are designed to evolve over a five-year 
stress horizon, with all five scenarios converging to a steady state after approximately eight years.

The methodology for estimating probability weights for each of the scenarios involves a comparison of the distribution of key historical UK and 
US macroeconomic variables against the forecast paths of the five scenarios. The methodology works such that the baseline (reflecting current 
consensus outlook) has the highest weight and the weights of adverse and favourable scenarios depend on the deviation from the baseline; 
the further from the baseline, the smaller the weight. A single set of five scenarios is used across all portfolios and all five weights are 
normalised to equate to 100%. The same scenarios and weights that are used in the estimation of expected credit losses are also used for the 
Barclays Group internal planning purposes. The impacts across the portfolios are different because of the sensitivities of each of the portfolios 
to specific macroeconomic variables, for example, mortgages are highly sensitive to house prices and base rates, credit cards and unsecured 
consumer loans are highly sensitive to unemployment. 

Definition of default, credit impaired assets, write-offs, and interest income recognition
The definition of default for the purpose of determining ECLs, and for internal credit risk management purposes, has been aligned to the 
Regulatory Capital CRR Article 178 definition of default, to maintain a consistent approach with IFRS 9 and associated regulatory guidance. 
The Regulatory Capital CRR Article 178 definition of default considers indicators that the debtor is unlikely to pay, includes exposures in 
forbearance and is no later than when the exposure is more than 90 days past due or 180 days past due in the case of UK mortgages. When 
exposures are identified as credit impaired or purchased or originated as such interest income is calculated on the carrying value net of the 
impairment allowance.

An asset is considered credit impaired when one or more events occur that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows 
of the financial asset. This comprises assets defined as defaulted and other individually assessed exposures where imminent default or actual 
loss is identified.

Uncollectable loans are written off against the related allowance for loan impairment on completion of the Group's internal processes and 
when all reasonably expected recoverable amounts have been collected. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited 
to the income statement. The timing and extent of write-offs may involve some element of subjective judgement. Nevertheless, a write-off will 
often be prompted by a specific event, such as the inception of insolvency proceedings or other formal recovery action, which makes it possible 
to establish that some or the entire advance is beyond realistic prospect of recovery.

Loan modifications and renegotiations that are not credit-impaired
When modification of a loan agreement occurs as a result of commercial restructuring activity rather than due to the credit risk of the 
borrower, an assessment must be performed to determine whether the terms of the new agreement are substantially different from the terms 
of the existing agreement. This assessment considers both the change in cash flows arising from the modified terms as well as the change 
in overall instrument risk profile. 

Where terms are substantially different, the existing loan will be derecognised and a new loan will be recognised at fair value, with any 
difference in valuation recognised immediately within the income statement, subject to observability criteria.

Where terms are not substantially different, the loan carrying value will be adjusted to reflect the present value of modified cash flows discounted 
at the original EIR, with any resulting gain or loss recognised immediately within the income statement as a modification gain or loss.

Expected life
Lifetime ECLs must be measured over the expected life. This is restricted to the maximum contractual life and takes into account expected 
prepayment, extension, call and similar options. The exceptions are certain revolver financial instruments, such as credit cards and bank 
overdrafts, that include both a drawn and an undrawn component where the entity's contractual ability to demand repayment and cancel the 
undrawn commitment does not limit the entity's exposure to credit losses to the contractual notice period. For revolving facilities, expected life 
is analytically derived to reflect behavioural life of the asset, i.e. the full period over which the business expects to be exposed to credit risk. 
Behavioural life is typically based upon historical analysis of the average time to default, closure or withdrawal of facility. Where data is 
insufficient or analysis inconclusive, an additional ‘maturity factor' may be incorporated to reflect the full estimated life of the exposures, based 
upon experienced judgement and/or peer analysis. Potential future modifications of contracts are not taken into account when determining 
the expected life or EAD until they occur.

Discounting
ECLs are discounted at the EIR at initial recognition or an approximation thereof and consistent with income recognition. For loan 
commitments the EIR is the rate that is expected to apply when the loan is drawn down and a financial asset is recognised. Issued financial 
guarantee contracts are discounted at the risk free rate. Lease receivables are discounted at the rate implicit in the lease. For variable/floating 
rate financial assets, the spot rate at the reporting date is used and projections of changes in the variable rate over the expected life are not 
made to estimate future interest cash flows or for discounting.

Modelling techniques
ECLs are calculated by multiplying three main components, being the PD, LGD and the EAD, discounted at the original EIR. The regulatory Basel 
Committee of Banking Supervisors (BCBS) ECL calculations are leveraged for IFRS 9 modelling but adjusted for key differences which include:

■■ BCBS requires 12 month through the economic cycle losses whereas IFRS 9 requires 12 months or lifetime point in time losses based on 
conditions at the reporting date and multiple forecasts of the future economic conditions over the expected lives

■■ IFRS 9 models do not include certain conservative BCBS model floors and downturn assessments and require discounting to the reporting 
date at the original EIR rather than using the cost of capital to the date of default

■■ management adjustments are made to modelled output to account for situations where known or expected risk factors and information 
have not been considered in the modelling process, for example forecast economic scenarios for uncertain political events, and

■■ ECL is measured at the individual financial instrument level, however a collective approach where financial instruments with similar risk 
characteristics are grouped together, with apportionment to individual financial instruments, is used where effects can only be seen at 
a collective level, for example for forward-looking information.

For the IFRS 9 impairment assessment, the Group's risk models are used to determine the PD, LGD and EAD. For Stage 2 and 3, the Group 
applies lifetime PDs but uses 12 month PDs for Stage 1. The ECL drivers of PD, EAD and LGD are modelled at an account level which considers 
vintage, among other credit factors. Also, the assessment of significant increase in credit risk is based on the initial lifetime PD curve, which 
accounts for the different credit risk underwritten over time.

Forbearance
A financial asset is subject to forbearance when it is modified due to the credit distress of the borrower. A modification made to the terms of an 
asset due to forbearance will typically be assessed as a non-substantial modification that does not result in derecognition of the original loan, 
except in circumstances where debt is exchanged for equity. 

Both performing and non-performing forbearance assets are classified as Stage 3 except where it is established that the concession granted 
has not resulted in diminished financial obligation and that no other regulatory definition of default criteria has been triggered, in which case 
the asset is classified as Stage 2. The minimum probationary period for non-performing forbearance is 12 months and for performing 
forbearance, 24 months. Hence, a minimum of 36 months is required for non-performing forbearance to move out of a forborne state.

No financial instrument in forbearance can transfer back to Stage 1 until all of the Stage 2 thresholds are no longer met and can only move out 
of Stage 3 when no longer credit impaired.

Accounting for the impairment of financial assets under IAS 39 for 2017 
Loans and other assets held at amortised cost 
In accordance with IAS 39, the Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that loan assets will not be 
recovered in full and, wherever necessary, recognises an impairment loss in the income statement. 

An impairment loss is recognised if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of events that have occurred and these have adversely 
impacted the estimated future cash flows from the assets. These events include:

■■ becoming aware of significant financial difficulty of the issuer or obligor
■■ a breach of contract, such as a default or delinquency in interest or principal payments
■■ the Group, for economic or legal reasons relating to the borrower's financial difficulty, grants a concession that it would not otherwise 

consider
■■ it becomes probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation
■■ the disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial difficulties
■■ observable data at a portfolio level indicating that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, although the decrease 

cannot yet be ascribed to individual financial assets in the portfolio – such as adverse changes in the payment status of borrowers in the 
portfolio or national or local economic conditions that correlate with defaults on the assets in the portfolio.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Performance/return

7 Credit impairment charges continued

Impairment assessments are conducted individually for significant assets, which comprise all wholesale customer loans and larger retail 
business loans, and collectively for smaller loans and for portfolio level risks, such as country or sectoral risks. For the purposes of the 
assessment, loans with similar credit risk characteristics are grouped together – generally on the basis of their product type, industry, 
geographical location, collateral type, past due status and other factors relevant to the evaluation of expected future cash flows.

The impairment assessment includes estimating the expected future cash flows from the asset or the group of assets, which are then 
discounted using the original effective interest rate calculated for the asset. If this is lower than the carrying value of the asset or the portfolio, 
an impairment allowance is raised.

If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases, and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after 
the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed by adjusting the allowance account. The amount of the 
reversal is recognised in the income statement.

Following impairment, interest income continues to be recognised at the original effective interest rate on the restated carrying amount, 
representing the unwind of the discount of the expected cash flows, including the principal due on non-accrual loans.

Uncollectable loans are written off against the related allowance for loan impairment on completion of the Group's internal processes when all 
reasonably expected recoverable amounts have been collected. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited to the 
income statement.

Available for sale financial assets
Impairment of available for sale debt instruments
Debt instruments are assessed for impairment in the same way as loans. If impairment is deemed to have occurred, the cumulative decline in 
the fair value of the instrument that has previously been recognised in the available for sale reserve is removed from reserves and recognised 
in the income statement. This may be reversed if there is evidence that the circumstances of the issuer have improved.

Impairment of available for sale equity instruments
Where there has been a prolonged or significant decline in the fair value of an equity instrument below its acquisition cost, it is deemed to be 
impaired. The cumulative net loss that has been previously recognised directly in the available for sale reserve is removed from reserves and 
recognised in the income statement.

Increases in the fair value of equity instruments after impairment are recognised directly in other comprehensive income. Further declines 
in the fair value of equity instruments after impairment are recognised in the income statement.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
IFRS 9 impairment involves several important areas of judgement, including estimating forward looking modelled parameters (PD, LGD and 
EAD), developing a range of unbiased future economic scenarios, estimating expected lives and assessing significant increases in credit risk, 
based on the Group's experience of managing credit risk. The determination of expected life is most material for Barclays credit card portfolios 
which is obtained via behavioural life analysis to materially capture the risk of these facilities. The behavioural life analysis for US Cards has 
been updated during the year to include more recent portfolio data, as a consequence the expected life of the US credit card portfolio has fallen 
from 10 years to seven years. For UK Cards, the expected life has similarly fallen from 10 years to eight years. These reductions led to 
management adjustment releases against impairment of £28m for US Cards and £9m for UK Cards.

Within the retail and small businesses portfolios, which comprise large numbers of small homogenous assets with similar risk characteristics 
where credit scoring techniques are generally used, the impairment allowance is calculated using forward-looking modelled parameters which 
are typically run at account level. There are many models in use, each tailored to a product, line of business or customer category. Judgement 
and knowledge is needed in selecting the statistical methods to use when the models are developed or revised. The impairment allowance 
reflected in the financial statements for these portfolios is therefore considered to be reasonable and supportable. The impairment charge 
reflected in the income statement for retail portfolios is £1,696m (2018: £1,598m; 2017: £2,095m) of the total impairment charge on loans 
and advances.

For individually significant assets in Stage 3, impairment allowances are calculated on an individual basis and all relevant considerations that 
have a bearing on the expected future cash flows across a range of economic scenarios are taken into account. These considerations can be 
subjective and can include the business prospects for the customer, the realisable value of collateral, the Group's position relative to other 
claimants, the reliability of customer information and the likely cost and duration of the work-out process. The level of the impairment 
allowance is the difference between the value of the discounted expected future cash flows (discounted at the loan's original effective interest 
rate), and its carrying amount. Furthermore, judgements change with time as new information becomes available or as work-out strategies 
evolve, resulting in frequent revisions to the impairment allowance as individual decisions are taken. Changes in these estimates would result in 
a change in the allowances and have a direct impact on the impairment charge. The impairment charge reflected in the financial statements in 
relation to wholesale portfolios is a charge of £208m (2018: release £133m; 2017: release £238m) of the total impairment charge on loans and 
advances. Further information on impairment allowances, impairment charges and related credit information is set out within the Risk review 
on page 151.

9 Tax

Accounting for income taxes
The Group applies IAS 12 Income Taxes in accounting for taxes on income. Income tax payable on taxable profits (current tax) is recognised 
as an expense in the periods in which the profits arise. Withholding taxes are also treated as income taxes. Income tax recoverable on tax 
allowable losses is recognised as a current tax asset only to the extent that it is regarded as recoverable by offsetting against taxable profits 
arising in the current or prior periods. Current tax is measured using tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted 
at the balance sheet date. 

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary 
differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised, except in certain circumstances where the 
deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that 
is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax is 
determined using tax rates and legislation enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date which are expected to apply when the 
deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset when there is both a legal 
right to set-off and an intention to settle on a net basis. 

The Group considers an uncertain tax position to exist when it considers that ultimately, in the future, the amount of profit subject to tax may 
be greater than the amount initially reflected in the Group's tax returns. The Group accounts for provisions in respect of uncertain tax positions 
in two different ways. 

A current tax provision is recognised when it is considered probable that the outcome of a review by a tax authority of an uncertain tax 
position will alter the amount of cash tax due to, or from, a tax authority in the future. From recognition, the current tax provision is then 
measured at the amount the Group ultimately expects to pay the tax authority to resolve the position. Effective from 1 January 2019, the Group 
changed its accounting policy on the accrual of interest and penalty amounts in respect of uncertain income tax positions and now recognises 
such amounts as an expense within profit before tax and will continue to do so in future periods. The prior periods' tax charges have not been 
restated because the accrual for interest and penalties in those periods in respect of uncertain tax positions was not material. 

Deferred tax provisions are adjustments made to the carrying value of deferred tax assets in respect of uncertain tax positions. A deferred tax 
provision is recognised when it is considered probable that the outcome of a review by a tax authority of an uncertain tax position will result 
in a reduction in the carrying value of the deferred tax asset. From recognition of a provision, measurement of the underlying deferred tax asset 
is adjusted to take into account the expected impact of resolving the uncertain tax position on the loss or temporary difference giving rise to 
the deferred tax asset. 

The approach taken to measurement takes account of whether the uncertain tax position is a discrete position that will be reviewed by the tax 
authority in isolation from any other position, or one of a number of issues which are expected to be reviewed together concurrently and 
resolved simultaneously with a tax authority. The Group's measurement of provisions is based upon its best estimate of the additional profit 
that will become subject to tax. For a discrete position, consideration is given only to the merits of that position. Where a number of issues are 
expected to be reviewed and resolved together, the Group will take into account not only the merits of its position in respect of each particular 
issue but also the overall level of provision relative to the aggregate of the uncertain tax positions across all the issues that are expected to be 
resolved at the same time. In addition, in assessing provision levels, it is assumed that tax authorities will review uncertain tax positions and 
that all facts will be fully and transparently disclosed. 

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
There are two key areas of judgement that impact the reported tax position. Firstly, the level of provisioning for uncertain tax positions; 
and secondly, the recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets. 

The Group does not consider there to be a significant risk of a material adjustment to the carrying amount of current and deferred tax 
balances, including provisions for uncertain tax positions in the next financial year. The provisions for uncertain tax positions cover a diverse 
range of issues and reflect advice from external counsel where relevant. It should be noted that only a proportion of the total uncertain tax 
positions will be under audit at any point in time, and could therefore be subject to challenge by a tax authority over the next year. 

Deferred tax assets have been recognised based on business profit forecasts. Details on the recognition of deferred tax assets are provided 
in this note.

Note
a From 2019, due to an IAS 12 update, the tax relief on payments in relation to AT1 instruments has been recognised in the tax charge of the income statement, whereas it was 

previously recorded in retained earnings. The tax charge for the current period has been reduced by £222m (relief at the standard UK corporation tax rate is £157m and the relief 
at the banking surcharge rate is £65m). Comparatives have been restated, reducing the tax charge for 2018 by £211m and 2017 by £174m (relief at the standard UK corporation 
tax rate is £148m (2018) and £123m (2017) and the relief at the banking surcharge rate is £63m (2018) and £51m (2017)). Further detail can be found in Note 1. 

Factors driving the effective tax rate
The effective tax rate of 23.0% is higher than the UK corporation tax rate of 19% primarily due to provisions for UK customer redress being 
non-deductible, profits earned outside the UK being taxed at local statutory tax rates that are higher than the UK tax rate, non-creditable taxes and 
non-deductible expenses including UK bank levy. In addition, the UK profits of banking companies are subject to a surcharge. These factors, which 
have each increased the effective tax rate, are partially offset by the impact of non-taxable gains and income in the period and tax relief on 
payments made under AT1 instruments, as well as adjustments in respect of prior periods.

Effective from 1 January 2019, a change in accounting standards requires the tax consequences of all payments on financial instruments that are 
classified as equity for accounting purposes, where those payments are considered to be a distribution of profit, to be included in the income 
statement tax charge. Excluding this accounting change which resulted in tax relief on payments in relation to AT1 instruments of £222m (2018: 
£211m) being included in the income statement tax charge, the Barclays Group's effective tax rate would have been 28.1% (2018: 32.1%).

The Barclays Group's future tax charge will be sensitive to the geographic mix of profits earned and the tax rates in force in the jurisdictions that 
the Barclays Group operates in. In the UK, legislation to reduce the corporation tax rate to 17% from 1 April 2020 has been enacted. However, the 
UK Government has announced its intention to introduce legislation to reverse the planned rate reduction and to maintain the current rate of 19%.

US deferred tax assets in the IHC and US Branch Tax Groups 
The deferred tax asset in the IHC Tax Group of £1,037m (2018: £1,454m) includes £54m (2018: £220m) relating to tax losses and the deferred 
tax asset in Barclays Bank PLC's US Branch Tax Group of £1,015m (2018: £1,087m) includes £84m (2018: £167m) relating to tax losses. Under 
US tax rules, losses occurring prior to 1 January 2018 can be carried forward and offset against profits for a period of 20 years. The losses first 
arose in 2011 in the IHC Tax Group and 2008 in the US Branch Tax Group and therefore, any unused amounts may begin to expire in 2031 and 
2028 respectively. The deferred tax assets for the IHC and the US Branch Tax Groups' tax losses are currently projected to be fully utilised by 2020.

UK Tax Group deferred tax asset
The deferred tax asset in the UK Tax Group of £818m (2018: £861m) includes £268m (2018: nil) relating to tax losses. There is no time limit 
on utilisation of UK tax losses and business profit forecasts indicate that these will be fully recovered.

Other deferred tax assets
The deferred tax asset of £420m (2018: £426m) in other entities within the Group includes £117m (2018: £142m) relating to tax losses. 
These deferred tax assets relate to a number of different territories and their recognition is based on profit forecasts or local country law which 
indicate that it is probable that the losses and temporary differences will be utilised.

Of the deferred tax asset of £420m (2018: £426m), an amount of £150m (2018: £247m) relates to entities which have suffered a loss in either 
the current or prior year. This has been taken into account in reaching the above conclusion that these deferred tax assets will be fully recovered 
in the future. 

The table below shows movements on deferred tax assets and liabilities during the year. The amounts are different from those disclosed on the 
balance sheet and in the preceding table as they are presented before offsetting asset and liability balances where there is a legal right to set-off

Note
a Following the adoption of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 on 1 January 2018, additional deferred tax assets of £627m were recognised.

Other movements include the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates as well as deferred tax amounts relating to acquisitions and disposals. 

The amount of deferred tax liability expected to be settled after more than 12 months is £1,199m (2018: £635m). The amount of deferred tax 
assets expected to be recovered after more than 12 months is £3,945m (2018: £3,703m). These amounts are before offsetting asset and liability 
balances where there is a legal right to set-off and an intention to settle on a net basis. 

Unrecognised deferred tax
Tax losses and temporary differences
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of gross deductible temporary differences of £213m (2018: £175m), unused tax credits 
of £247m (2018: £198m), and gross tax losses of £19,582m (2018: £16,313m). The tax losses include capital losses of £3,980m (2018: £3,225m). 
Of these tax losses, £41m (2018: £240m) expire within five years, £239m (2018: £259m) expire within six to 10 years, £5,178m (2018: £948m) 
expire within 11 to 20 years and £14,124m (2018: £14,866m) can be carried forward indefinitely. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised 
in respect of these items because it is not probable that future taxable profits and gains will be available against which they can be utilised. 

Group investments in subsidiaries, branches and associates
Deferred tax is not recognised in respect of the value of the Barclays Group's investments in subsidiaries, branches and associates where the 
Barclays Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse 
in the foreseeable future. The aggregate amount of these temporary differences for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 
£0.7bn (2018: £0.6bn).

The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the profit attributable to equity holders of the parent and the basic weighted average 
number of shares excluding treasury shares held in employee benefit trusts or held for trading. When calculating the diluted earnings per share, 
the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted for the effects of all expected dilutive potential ordinary shares held in respect of 
Barclays PLC, totalling 282m (2018: 308m) shares. The total number of share options outstanding, under schemes considered to be potentially 
dilutive, was 533m (2018: 544m). These options have strike prices ranging from £1.19 to £2.27.

Of the total number of employee share options and share awards at 31 December 2019, 43m (2018: 43m) were anti-dilutive.

The 125m (2018: 79m) increase in the basic weighted average number of shares are primarily due to shares issued under employee share 
schemes and the Scrip Dividend Programme.

11 Dividends on ordinary shares
The Directors have approved a total dividend in respect of 2019 of 9.0p per ordinary share of 25p each. The remaining full year dividend for 2019 
of 6.0p per ordinary share will be paid on 3 April 2020 to shareholders on the Share Register on 28 February 2020 following the 3.0p half year 
dividend paid on 23 September 2019. On 31 December 2019, there were 17,322m ordinary shares in issue. The financial statements for the 
year ended 31 December 2019 do not reflect this dividend, which will be accounted for in shareholders' equity as an appropriation of retained 
profits in the year ending 31 December 2020. The 2019 financial statements include the 2019 half year dividend of £517m (2018: £427m) and 
a full year dividend declared in relation to 2018 of £684m (2018: £341m). Dividends are funded out of distributable reserves.

Assets and liabilities held at fair value

The notes included in this section focus on assets and liabilities the Group holds and recognises at fair value. Fair value refers to the price that 
would be received to sell an asset or the price that would be paid to transfer a liability in an arm's-length transaction with a willing 
counterparty, which may be an observable market price or, where there is no quoted price for the instrument, may be an estimate based on 
available market data. Detail regarding the Group's approach to managing market risk can be found on page 141.

12 Trading portfolio

Accounting for trading portfolio assets and liabilities
In accordance with IFRS 9, all assets and liabilities held for trading purposes are held at fair value with gains and losses in the changes in fair 
value taken to the income statement in net trading income (Note 5).

13 Financial assets at fair value through the income statement

Accounting for financial assets mandatorily at fair value
Financial assets that are held for trading are recognised at fair value through profit or loss. In addition, financial assets are held at fair value 
through profit or loss if they do not contain contractual terms that give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI, or if the financial 
asset is not held in a business model that is either (i) a business model to collect the contractual cash flows or (ii) a business model that is 
achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling. 

Accounting for financial assets designated at fair value
Financial assets, other than those held for trading, are classified in this category if they are so irrevocably designated at inception and the use 
of the designation removes or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch.

Subsequent changes in fair value for these instruments are recognised in the income statement in net investment income, except if reporting it 
in trading income reduces an accounting mismatch. 

The details on how the fair value amounts are derived for financial assets at fair value are described in Note 17.

14 Derivative financial instruments 

Accounting for derivatives
Derivative instruments are contracts whose value is derived from one or more underlying financial instruments or indices defined in the 
contract. They include swaps, forward-rate agreements, futures, options and combinations of these instruments and primarily affect the 
Group's net interest income, net trading income and derivative assets and liabilities. Notional amounts of the contracts are not recorded on the 
balance sheet. Derivatives are used to hedge interest rate, credit risk, inflation risk, exchange rate, commodity, and equity exposures and 
exposures to certain indices such as house price indices and retail price indices related to non-trading positions. 

All derivative instruments are held at fair value through profit or loss, except for derivatives that are in a designated cash flow or net investment 
hedge accounting relationship. Derivatives are classified as assets when their fair value is positive or as liabilities when their fair value is 
negative. This includes terms included in a contract or financial liability (the host), which, had it been a standalone contract, would have met 
the definition of a derivative. If these are separated from the host, i.e. when the economic characteristics of the embedded derivative are not 
closely related with those of the host contract and the combined instrument is not measured at fair value through profit or loss, then they are 
accounted for in the same way as derivatives. For financial assets, the requirements are whether the financial asset contain contractual terms 
that give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI, and consequently the requirements for accounting for embedded derivatives are 
not applicable to financial assets. 

Hedge accounting
The Group applies the requirements of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement for hedge accounting purposes. The 
Group applies hedge accounting to represent the economic effects of its interest rate, currency and contractually linked inflation risk 
management strategies. Where derivatives are held for risk management purposes, and when transactions meet the required criteria for 
documentation and hedge effectiveness, the Group applies fair value hedge accounting, cash flow hedge accounting, or hedging of a net 
investment in a foreign operation, as appropriate to the risks being hedged. 

The Group has elected to early adopt the ‘Amendments to IAS 39 and IFRS 7 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform' issued in September 2019. In 
accordance with the transition provisions, the amendments have been adopted retrospectively to hedging relationships that existed at the start 
of the reporting period or were designated thereafter, and to the amount accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve at that date.

The amendments provide temporary relief from applying specific hedge accounting requirements to hedging relationships directly affected by 
IBOR (Interbank Offered Rates) reform. The reliefs have the effect that IBOR reform should not generally cause hedge accounting to terminate. 
However, any hedge ineffectiveness continues to be recorded in the income statement. Furthermore, the amendments set out triggers for 
when the reliefs will end, which include the uncertainty arising from interest rate benchmark reform no longer being present.

In summary, the reliefs provided by the amendments that apply to the Group are:

■■ When considering the ‘highly probable' requirement, the Group has assumed that the IBOR interest rates upon which our hedged items are 
based do not change as a result of IBOR reform.

■■ In assessing whether the hedge is expected to be highly effective on a forward-looking basis the Group has assumed that the IBOR interest 
rates upon which the cash flows of the hedged items and the interest rate swaps that hedge them are based are not altered by IBOR reform.

■■ The Group will not discontinue hedge accounting during the period of IBOR-related uncertainty solely because the retrospective 
effectiveness falls outside the required 80–125% range.

■■ The Group has not recycled the cash flow hedge reserve relating to the period after the reforms are expected to take effect.
■■ The Group has assessed whether the hedged IBOR risk component is a separately identifiable risk only when it first designates a hedged 

item in a fair value hedge and not on an ongoing basis.

Further amendments are expected for future accounting periods following completion of the second part of the IASB's two-phased project 
which focuses on the impacts of IBOR reform on financial reporting.

Fair value hedge accounting 
Changes in fair value of derivatives that qualify and are designated as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with 
changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. The fair value changes adjust the carrying value 
of the hedged asset or liability held at amortised cost.

If hedge relationships no longer meet the criteria for hedge accounting, hedge accounting is discontinued. For fair value hedges of interest rate 
risk, the fair value adjustment to the hedged item is amortised to the income statement over the period to maturity of the previously 
designated hedge relationship using the effective interest method. If the hedged item is sold or repaid, the unamortised fair value adjustment is 
recognised immediately in the income statement. For items classified as fair value through other comprehensive income, the hedge accounting 
adjustment is included in other comprehensive income. 

Cash flow hedge accounting
For qualifying cash flow hedges, the fair value gain or loss associated with the effective portion of the cash flow hedge is recognised initially in 
other comprehensive income, and then recycled to the income statement in the periods when the hedged item will affect profit or loss. Any 
ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the income statement immediately.

When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss 
existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the hedged item is ultimately recognised in the income statement. 
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was recognised in equity is immediately 
transferred to the income statement.

Hedges of net investments 
The Group's net investments in foreign operations, including monetary items accounted for as part of the net investment, are hedged for 
foreign currency risks using both derivatives and foreign currency borrowings. Hedges of net investments are accounted for similarly to cash 
flow hedges; the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is being recognised directly in other comprehensive income 
and the ineffective portion being recognised immediately in the income statement. The cumulative gain or loss recognised in other 
comprehensive income is recognised in the income statement on the disposal or partial disposal of the foreign operation, or other reductions 
in the Group's investment in the operation.

 14 Derivative financial instruments continued

Hedge accounting
Hedge accounting is applied predominantly for the following risks:

■■ interest rate risk – arises due to a mismatch between fixed interest rates and floating interest rates. Interest rate risk also includes exposure 
to inflation risk for certain types of investments

■■ currency risk – arises due to assets or liabilities being denominated in different currencies than the functional currency of the relevant entity. 
At a consolidated level, currency risk also arises when the functional currency of subsidiaries are different from the parent

■■ contractually linked inflation risk – arises from financial instruments within contractually specified inflation risk. The Group does not hedge 
inflation risk that arises from other activities.

In order to hedge these risks, the Group uses the following hedging instruments:

■■ interest rate derivatives to swap interest rate exposures into either fixed or variable rates
■■ currency derivatives to swap foreign currency net investment exposure to local currency
■■ inflation derivatives to swap inflation exposure into either fixed or variable interest rates.

In some cases, certain items which are economically hedged may be ineligible hedged items for the purposes of IAS 39, such as core deposits and 
equity. In these instances, a proxy hedging solution can be utilised whereby portfolios of floating rate assets are designated as eligible hedged 
items in cash flow hedges.

In some hedging relationships, the Group designates risk components of hedged items as follows:

■■ benchmark interest rate risk as a component of interest rate risk, such as the LIBOR or Risk Free Rate (RFR) component
■■ inflation risk as a contractually specified component of a debt instrument
■■ spot exchange rate risk for foreign currency financial assets or financial liabilities
■■ components of cash flows of hedged items, for example certain interest payments for part of the life of an instrument.

Using the benchmark interest rate risk results in other risks, such as credit risk and liquidity risk, being excluded from the hedge accounting 
relationship. LIBOR is considered the predominant interest rate risk and therefore the hedged items change in fair value on a fully proportionate 
basis with reference to this risk.

In respect of many of the Group's hedge accounting relationships, the hedged item and hedging instrument change frequently due to the dynamic 
nature of the risk management and hedge accounting strategy. The Group applies hedge accounting to dynamic scenarios, predominantly in 
relation to interest rate risk, with a combination of hedged items in order for its financial statements to reflect as closely as possible the economic 
risk management undertaken. In some cases, if the hedge accounting objective changes, the relevant hedge accounting relationship is 
de-designated and is replaced with a different hedge accounting relationship.

Changes in the GBP value of net investments due to foreign currency movements are captured in the currency translation reserve, resulting in a 
movement in CET1 capital. The Group mitigates this by matching the CET1 capital movements to the revaluation of the foreign currency RWA 
exposures. Net investment hedges are designated where necessary to reduce the exposure to movement in a particular exchange rate to within 
limits mandated by risk. As far as possible, existing external currency liabilities are designated as the hedging instruments.

The hedging instruments share the same risk exposures as the hedged items. Hedge effectiveness is determined with reference to quantitative 
tests, predominantly regression testing, but to the extent hedging instruments are exposed to different risks than the hedged items, this could 
result in hedge ineffectiveness or hedge accounting failures.

Sources of ineffectiveness include the following:

■■ mismatches between the contractual terms of the hedged item and hedging instrument, including basis differences
■■ changes in credit risk of the hedging instruments
■■ if a hedging relationship becomes over-hedged, for example in hedges of net investments if the net asset value designated at the start of the 

period falls below the amount of the hedging instrument
■■ cash flow hedges using external swaps with non-zero fair values
■■ the effects of the forthcoming reforms to IBOR because these might take effect at a different time and have a different impact on hedged items 

and hedging instruments.

Across all benchmarks which Barclays is materially exposed to, there is still uncertainty regarding the precise timing and effects of IBOR reform. 
There is yet to be full consensus regarding methodologies for converging existing IBORs to their final benchmark rates. As such, Barclays has not 
incorporated any change in assumptions for affected benchmarks into its expectations or calculations. Barclays does, however, assume sufficient 
liquidity in IBOR linked benchmarks to provide reliable valuation calculations of both hedged items and hedging instruments (notwithstanding 
reliefs already applied within the financial reporting).

Interest Rate Benchmark Reform
Following the financial crisis, the reform and replacement of benchmark interest rates such as IBOR has become a priority for global regulators. 
Since the changes are market driven, there is currently some uncertainty around the timing and precise nature of these changes. 

The Group's risk exposure is directly affected by interest rate benchmark reform, across both its cash flow hedge accounting activities; where 
IBOR-linked derivatives are designated as a cash flow hedge of IBOR-linked cash flows, and its fair value hedge accounting activities; where 
IBOR-linked derivatives are designated as a fair value hedge of fixed interest rate assets and liabilities.

The Group's risk exposure is predominately to GBP, USD, EUR, JPY and AUD LIBOR with the vast majority concentrated in derivatives within the 
Corporate and Investment Bank. Some additional exposure resides on floating rate loans and advances and debt securities held and issued within 
the Corporate and Investment Bank. Retail lending and mortgage exposure in Barclays UK is minimal. Approaches to transition will vary product by 
product, and counterparty by counterparty. Barclays expected derivative contracts facing central clearing counterparties to follow a market-wide, 
standardised approach to reform. Whereas bilateral derivative agreements, loan agreements and other cash securities to largely be negotiated 
bilaterally with the counterparty.

There are key differences between IBORs and RFRs. IBORs are ‘term rates', which means that they are published for a borrowing period (for 
example three months), and they are ‘forward-looking', because they are published at the beginning of a borrowing period, based upon an 
estimated inter-bank borrowing cost for the period. RFRs are typically ‘backward-looking' rates, as they are based upon overnight rates from 
actual transactions, and are therefore published at the end of the overnight borrowing period. Furthermore, IBORs include a credit spread over the 
RFR. Therefore, to transition existing contracts and agreements to RFR, adjustments for term and credit differences may need to be applied to 
RFR-linked rates to enable the two benchmarks to be economically equivalent upon transition. The methodologies for determining these 
adjustments are undergoing in-depth consultations by industry working groups, on behalf of the respective global regulators and related market 
participants.

Barclays has established a Group-wide LIBOR Transition Programme, with oversight from the Group Finance Director and with cross-business line 
and functions-support governance. The Transition Programme follows a risk management approach, based upon recognised ‘change delivery' 
control standards, to drive strategic execution, and identify, manage and resolve key risks and issues as they arise. Accountable Executives are in 
place within key working groups, with overall Board oversight delegated to the Board Risk Committee and the Group Finance Director. Barclays 
performs a prominent stewardship role to drive orderly transition via our representation on official sector and industry working groups across all 
major jurisdictions and product classes. The Group is actively engaging with the counterparties to include appropriate fallback provisions in its 
floating rate assets and liabilities with maturities after 2021, when most IBORs are expected to cease to exist. We expect that the hedging 
instruments will be modified by the amendments to the 2006 ISDA definitions that will include fallback provisions for when the existing IBORs are 
permanently discontinued. Additionally, the Group Finance Director is Chair of the UK's ‘Working Group on Sterling Risk-Free Reference Rates', 
whose mandate is to catalyse a broad-based transition to using SONIA (Sterling Overnight Index Average) as the primary Sterling interest rate 
benchmark in bond, loan and derivatives markets. Further, hedge accounting specific impacts of IBOR reform are expected as transition 
progresses, with impact on financial reporting becoming clearer following anticipated completion of Phase 2 of the IASB's IBOR Reform project.

The Group's exposure risk management also includes the use of the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR). The calculation methodology of 
EURIBOR changed during 2019. In July 2019, the Belgian Financial Services and Markets Authority granted authorisation with respect to EURIBOR 
under the European Union Benchmarks Regulation. This allows market participants to continue to use EURIBOR after 1 January 2020 for both 
existing and new contracts. The Group expects that EURIBOR will continue to exist as a benchmark rate for the foreseeable future. The Group 
does not anticipate changing the hedged risk to a different benchmark. For these reasons, the Group does not consider its fair value or cash flow 
hedges of the EURIBOR benchmark interest rate to be directly affected by interest rate benchmark reform at 31 December 2019.

Assets and liabilities held at fair value
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

15 Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income

Accounting for financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) under IFRS 9 effective from 
1 January 2018
Financial assets that are debt instruments held in a business model that is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling and 
that contain contractual terms that give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI are measured at FVOCI. They are subsequently 
remeasured at fair value and changes therein (except for those relating to impairment, interest income and foreign currency exchange gains 
and losses) are recognised in other comprehensive income until the assets are sold. Interest (calculated using the effective interest method) is 
recognised in the income statement in net interest income (Note 3). Upon disposal, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in other 
comprehensive income is included in net investment income.

In determining whether the business model is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets, it is determined 
that both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets are integral to achieving the objective of the business model. The Group 
will consider past sales and expectations about future sales to establish if the business model is achieved.

For equity securities that are not held for trading, the Group may make an irrevocable election on initial recognition to present subsequent 
changes in the fair value of the instrument in other comprehensive income (except for dividend income which is recognised in profit or loss). 
Gains or losses on the derecognition of these equity securities are not transferred to profit or loss. These assets are also not subject to the 
impairment requirements and therefore no amounts are recycled to the income statement. Where the Group has not made the irrevocable 
election to present subsequent changes in the fair value of the instrument in other comprehensive income, equity securities are measured at 
fair value through profit or loss.

Accounting for financial investments under IAS 39 for 2017
Available for sale financial assets are held at fair value with gains and losses being included in other comprehensive income. The Group uses 
this classification for assets that are not derivatives and are not held for trading purposes or otherwise designated at fair value through profit or 
loss, or at amortised cost. Dividends and interest (calculated using the effective interest method) are recognised in the income statement in net 
interest income or, net investment income. On disposal, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is also included 
in net investment income.

Held to maturity assets are held at amortised cost. The Group uses this classification when there is an intent and ability to hold the asset to 
maturity. Interest on the investments are recognised in the income statement within net interest income.

16 Financial liabilities designated at fair value

Accounting for liabilities designated at fair value through profit and loss
In accordance with IFRS 9, financial liabilities may be designated at fair value, with gains and losses taken to the income statement within net 
trading income (Note 5) and net investment income (Note 6). Movements in own credit are reported through other comprehensive income, 
unless the effects of changes in the liability's credit risk would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in P&L. In these scenarios, all gains 
and losses on that liability (including the effects of changes in the credit risk of the liability) are presented in P&L. On derecognition of the 
financial liability no amount relating to own credit risk are recycled to the income statement. The Group has the ability to make the fair value 
designation when holding the instruments at fair value reduces an accounting mismatch (caused by an offsetting liability or asset being held at 
fair value), or is managed by the Group on the basis of its fair value, or includes terms that have substantive derivative characteristics (Note 14).

The details on how the fair value amounts are arrived for financial liabilities designated at fair value are described in Note 17.

17 Fair value of financial instruments

Accounting for financial assets and liabilities – fair values
Financial instruments that are held for trading are recognised at fair value through profit or loss. In addition, financial assets are held at fair 
value through profit or loss if they do not contain contractual terms that give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI, or if the 
financial asset is not held in a business model that is either (i) a business model to collect the contractual cash flows or (ii) a business model 
that is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling. Subsequent changes in fair value for these instruments are recognised in 
the income statement in net investment income, except if reporting it in trading income reduces an accounting mismatch. 

All financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date of initial recognition (including transaction costs, other than financial 
instruments held at fair value through profit or loss) and depending on the subsequent classification of the financial asset or liability, may 
continue to be held at fair value either through profit or loss or other comprehensive income. The fair value of a financial instrument is the 
price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the 
measurement date.

Wherever possible, fair value is determined by reference to a quoted market price for that instrument. For many of the Group's financial assets 
and liabilities, especially derivatives, quoted prices are not available and valuation models are used to estimate fair value. The models calculate 
the expected cash flows under the terms of each specific contract and then discount these values back to a present value. These models use as 
their basis independently sourced market inputs including, for example, interest rate yield curves, equities and commodities prices, option 
volatilities and currency rates.

For financial liabilities measured at fair value, the carrying amount reflects the effect on fair value of changes in own credit spreads derived 
from observable market data such as in primary issuance and redemption activity for structured notes. 

On initial recognition, it is presumed that the transaction price is the fair value unless there is observable information available in an active 
market to the contrary. The best evidence of an instrument's fair value on initial recognition is typically the transaction price. However, if fair 
value can be evidenced by comparison with other observable current market transactions in the same instrument, or is based on a valuation 
technique whose inputs include only data from observable markets, then the instrument should be recognised at the fair value derived from 
such observable market data.

For valuations that have made use of unobservable inputs, the difference between the model valuation and the initial transaction price (Day 
One profit) is recognised in profit or loss either: on a straight-line basis over the term of the transaction; or over the period until all model inputs 
will become observable where appropriate; or released in full when previously unobservable inputs become observable.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

17 Fair value of financial instruments continued

Various factors influence the availability of observable inputs and these may vary from product to product and change over time. Factors 
include the depth of activity in the relevant market, the type of product, whether the product is new and not widely traded in the marketplace, 
the maturity of market modelling and the nature of the transaction (bespoke or generic). To the extent that valuation is based on models or 
inputs that are not observable in the market, the determination of fair value can be more subjective, dependent on the significance of the 
unobservable input to the overall valuation. Unobservable inputs are determined based on the best information available, for example by 
reference to similar assets, similar maturities or other analytical techniques. 

The sensitivity of valuations used in the financial statements to possible changes in significant unobservable inputs is shown on page 288.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The valuation of financial instruments often involves a significant degree of judgement and complexity, in particular where valuation models 
make use of unobservable inputs (‘Level 3' assets and liabilities). This note provides information on these instruments, including the related 
unrealised gains and losses recognised in the period, a description of significant valuation techniques and unobservable inputs, and a 
sensitivity analysis.

Valuation
IFRS 13 Fair value measurement requires an entity to classify its assets and liabilities according to a hierarchy that reflects the observability of 
significant market inputs. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are defined below.

Quoted market prices – Level 1 
Assets and liabilities are classified as Level 1 if their value is observable in an active market. Such instruments are valued by reference to 
unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets where the quoted price is readily available, and the price represents 
actual and regularly occurring market transactions. An active market is one in which transactions occur with sufficient volume and frequency to 
provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. 

Valuation technique using observable inputs – Level 2 
Assets and liabilities classified as Level 2 have been valued using models whose inputs are observable either directly or indirectly. Valuations based 
on observable inputs include assets and liabilities such as swaps and forwards which are valued using market standard pricing techniques, and 
options that are commonly traded in markets where all the inputs to the market standard pricing models are observable. 

Valuation technique using significant unobservable inputs – Level 3 
Assets and liabilities are classified as Level 3 if their valuation incorporates significant inputs that are not based on observable market data 
(unobservable inputs). A valuation input is considered observable if it can be directly observed from transactions in an active market, or if there is 
compelling external evidence demonstrating an executable exit price. Unobservable input levels are generally determined via reference to 
observable inputs, historical observations or using other analytical techniques. 

The following table shows the Barclays Group's assets and liabilities that are held at fair value disaggregated by valuation technique (fair value 
hierarchy) and balance sheet classification:

Valuation techniques and sensitivity analysis
Sensitivity analysis is performed on products with significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) to generate a range of reasonably possible alternative 
valuations. The sensitivity methodologies applied take account of the nature of the valuation techniques used, as well as the availability and 
reliability of observable proxy and historical data and the impact of using alternative models. 

Sensitivities are dynamically calculated on a monthly basis. The calculation is based on range or spread data of a reliable reference source or a 
scenario based on relevant market analysis alongside the impact of using alternative models. Sensitivities are calculated without reflecting the 
impact of any diversification in the portfolio. 

The valuation techniques used, observability and sensitivity analysis for material products within Level 3, are described below.

Interest rate derivatives
Description: Derivatives linked to interest rates or inflation indices. The category includes futures, interest rate and inflation swaps, swaptions, 
caps, floors, inflation options, balance guaranteed swaps and other exotic interest rate derivatives.

Valuation: Interest rate and inflation derivatives are generally valued using curves of forward rates constructed from market data to project and 
discount the expected future cash flows of trades. Instruments with optionality are valued using volatilities implied from market inputs, and use 
industry standard or bespoke models depending on the product type. 

Observability: In general, inputs are considered observable up to liquid maturities which are determined separately for each input and underlying. 
Unobservable inputs are generally set by referencing liquid market instruments and applying extrapolation techniques or inferred via another 
reasonable method.

Foreign exchange derivatives
Description: Derivatives linked to the foreign exchange (FX) market. The category includes FX forward contracts, FX swaps and FX options. 
The majority are traded as over the counter (OTC) derivatives.

Valuation: FX derivatives are valued using industry standard and bespoke models depending on the product type. Valuation inputs include FX 
rates, interest rates, FX volatilities, interest rate volatilities, FX interest rate correlations and others as appropriate. 

Observability: FX correlations, forwards and volatilities are generally observable up to liquid maturities which are determined separately for each 
input and underlying. Unobservable inputs are set by referencing liquid market instruments and applying extrapolation techniques, or inferred 
via another reasonable method.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

17 Fair value of financial instruments continued
Credit derivatives
Description: Derivatives linked to the credit spread of a referenced entity, index or basket of referenced entities or a pool of referenced assets (e.g. a 
securitised product). The category includes single name and index credit default swaps (CDS) and asset backed CDS.

Valuation: CDS are valued on industry standard models using curves of credit spreads as the principal input. Credit spreads are observed directly 
from broker data, third party vendors or priced to proxies.

Observability: CDS contracts referencing entities that are actively traded are generally considered observable. Other valuation inputs are 
considered observable if products with significant sensitivity to the inputs are actively traded in a liquid market. Unobservable valuation inputs are 
generally determined with reference to recent transactions or inferred from observable trades of the same issuer or similar entities.

Equity derivatives
Description: Exchange traded or OTC derivatives linked to equity indices and single names. The category includes vanilla and exotic equity 
products.

Valuation: Equity derivatives are valued using industry standard models. Valuation inputs include stock prices, dividends, volatilities, interest rates, 
equity repurchase curves and, for multi-asset products, correlations.

Observability: In general, valuation inputs are observable up to liquid maturities which are determined separately for each input and underlying. 
Unobservable inputs are set by referencing liquid market instruments and applying extrapolation techniques, or inferred via another reasonable 
method.

Commodity derivatives
Description: Exchange traded and OTC derivatives based on underlying commodities such as metals, crude oil and refined products, agricultural, 
power and natural gas. 

Valuation: Commodity swaps and options are valued using models incorporating discounting of cash flows and other industry standard modelling 
techniques. Valuation inputs include forward curves, volatilities implied from market observable inputs and correlations. 

Observability: Commodity correlations, forwards and volatilities are generally observable up to liquid maturities which are determined separately 
for each input and underlying. Unobservable inputs are set with reference to similar observable products, or by applying extrapolation techniques 
to observable inputs.

Corporate debt
Description: Primarily corporate bonds. 

Valuation: Corporate bonds are valued using observable market prices sourced from broker quotes, inter-dealer prices or other reliable pricing 
sources. 

Observability: Prices for actively traded bonds are considered observable. Unobservable bonds prices are generally determined by reference to 
bond yields or CDS spreads for actively traded instruments issued by or referencing the same (or a similar) issuer.

Reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements
Description: Includes securities purchased under resale agreements, securities sold under repurchase agreements, and other similar secured 
lending agreements. The agreements are primarily short-term in nature.

Valuation: Repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements are generally valued by discounting the expected future cash flows using industry 
standard models that incorporate market interest rates and repurchase rates, based on the specific details of the transaction.

Observability: Inputs are deemed observable up to liquid maturities, and are determined based on the specific features of the transaction. 
Unobservable inputs are generally set by referencing liquid market instruments and applying extrapolation techniques, or inferred via another 
reasonable method.

Non-asset backed loans
Description: Largely made up of fixed rate loans.

Valuation: Fixed rate loans are valued using models that discount expected future cash flows based on interest rates and loan spreads. 

Observability: Within this loan population, the loan spread is generally unobservable. Unobservable loan spreads are determined by incorporating 
funding costs, the level of comparable assets such as gilts, issuer credit quality and other factors.

Asset backed securities
Description: Securities that are linked to the cash flows of a pool of referenced assets via securitisation. The category includes residential mortgage 
backed securities, commercial mortgage backed securities, CDOs, collateralised loan obligations (CLOs) and other asset backed securities.

Valuation: Where available, valuations are based on observable market prices sourced from broker quotes and inter-dealer prices. Otherwise, 
valuations are determined using industry standard discounted cash flow analysis that calculates the fair value based on valuation inputs such as 
constant default rate, conditional prepayment rate, loss given default and yield. These inputs are determined by reference to a number of sources 
including proxying to observed transactions, market indices or market research, and by assessing underlying collateral performance. 

Proxying to observed transactions, indices or research requires an assessment and comparison of the relevant securities' underlying attributes 
including collateral, tranche, vintage, underlying asset composition (historical losses, borrower characteristics and loan attributes such as loan to 
value ratio and geographic concentration) and credit ratings (original and current).

Observability: Where an asset backed product does not have an observable market price and the valuation is determined using a discounted cash 
flow analysis, the instrument is considered unobservable. 

Equity cash products
Description: Includes listed equities, Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) and preference shares.

Valuation: Valuation of equity cash products is primarily determined through market observable prices.

Observability: Prices for actively traded equity cash products are considered observable. Unobservable equity prices are generally determined by 
reference to actively traded instruments that are similar in nature, or inferred via another reasonable method.

Private equity investments
Description: Includes private equity holdings and principal investments. 

Valuation: Private equity investments are valued in accordance with the ‘International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines' 
which require the use of a number of individual pricing benchmarks such as the prices of recent transactions in the same or similar entities, 
discounted cash flow analysis and comparison with the earnings multiples of listed companies. While the valuation of unquoted equity 
instruments is subjective by nature, the relevant methodologies are commonly applied by other market participants and have been consistently 
applied over time.

Observability: Inputs are considered observable if there is active trading in a liquid market of products with significant sensitivity to the inputs. 
Unobservable inputs include earnings estimates, multiples of comparative companies, marketability discounts and discount rates.

Other
Description: Other includes commercial real estate loans, funds and fund-linked products, asset backed loans, physical commodities and 
investment property.

Assets and liabilities reclassified between Level 1 and Level 2
During the period, there were no material transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 (2018: there were no material transfers between Level 1  
and Level 2).

Level 3 movement analysis
The following table summarises the movements in the Level 3 balances during the period. The table shows gains and losses and includes amounts 
for all financial assets and liabilities that are held at fair value transferred to and from Level 3 during the period. Transfers have been reflected as if 
they had taken place at the beginning of the year.

Asset and liability transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 are primarily due to i) an increase or decrease in observable market activity related to an 
input or ii) a change in the significance of the unobservable input, with assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 if an unobservable input is 
deemed significant.

17 Fair value of financial instruments continued
The following section describes the significant unobservable inputs identified in the table above, and the sensitivity of fair value measurement of 
the instruments categorised as Level 3 assets or liabilities to increases in significant unobservable inputs. Where sensitivities are described, the 
inverse relationship will also generally apply.

Where reliable interrelationships can be identified between significant unobservable inputs used in fair value measurement, a description of those 
interrelationships is included below.

Forwards
A price or rate that is applicable to a financial transaction that will take place in the future.

In general, a significant increase in a forward in isolation will result in a fair value increase for the contracted receiver of the underlying (currency, 
bond, commodity, etc.), but the sensitivity is dependent on the specific terms of the instrument.

Credit spread
Credit spreads typically represent the difference in yield between an instrument and a benchmark security or reference rate. Credit spreads reflect 
the additional yield that a market participant demands for taking on exposure to the credit risk of an instrument and form part of the yield used in 
a discounted cash flow calculation.

In general, a significant increase in credit spread in isolation will result in a movement in a fair value decrease for a cash asset.

For a derivative instrument, a significant increase in credit spread in isolation can result in a fair value increase or decrease depending on the 
specific terms of the instrument.

Volatility
Volatility is a measure of the variability or uncertainty in return for a given derivative underlying. It is an estimate of how much a particular 
underlying instrument input or index will change in value over time. In general, volatilities are implied from observed option prices. For 
unobservable options the implied volatility may reflect additional assumptions about the nature of the underlying risk, and the strike/maturity 
profile of a specific contract.

In general a significant increase in volatility in isolation will result in a fair value increase for the holder of a simple option, but the sensitivity is 
dependent on the specific terms of the instrument. 

There may be interrelationships between unobservable volatilities and other unobservable inputs (e.g. when equity prices fall, implied equity 
volatilities generally rise) but these are generally specific to individual markets and may vary over time.

Correlation
Correlation is a measure of the relationship between the movements of two variables. Correlation can be a significant input into valuation of 
derivative contracts with more than one underlying instrument. Credit correlation generally refers to the correlation between default processes for 
the separate names that make up the reference pool of a CDO structure.

A significant increase in correlation in isolation can result in a fair value increase or decrease depending on the specific terms of the instrument.

Comparable price
Comparable instrument prices are used in valuation by calculating an implied yield (or spread over a liquid benchmark) from the price of a 
comparable observable instrument, then adjusting that yield (or spread) to account for relevant differences such as maturity or credit quality. 
Alternatively, a price-to-price basis can be assumed between the comparable and unobservable instruments in order to establish a value.

In general, a significant increase in comparable price in isolation will result in an increase in the price of the unobservable instrument. For 
derivatives, a change in the comparable price in isolation can result in a fair value increase or decrease depending on the specific terms of the 
instrument.

Loan spread
Loan spreads typically represent the difference in yield between an instrument and a benchmark security or reference rate. Loan spreads typically 
reflect credit quality, the level of comparable assets such as gilts and other factors, and form part of the yield used in a discounted cash flow 
calculation.

The ESHLA portfolio primarily consists of long dated fixed rate loans extended to counterparties in the UK Education, Social Housing and Local 
Authority sectors. The loans are categorised as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to their illiquid nature and the significance of unobservable 
loan spreads to the valuation. Valuation uncertainty arises from the long dated nature of the portfolio, the lack of secondary market in the loans 
and the lack of observable loan spreads. The majority of ESHLA loans are to borrowers in heavily regulated sectors that are considered extremely 
low credit risk, and have a history of near zero defaults since inception. While the overall loan spread range is from 31bps to 1,884bps (2018: 30bps 
to 531bps), the vast majority of spreads are concentrated towards the bottom end of this range, with 99% of the loan notional being valued with 
spreads less than 200bps consistently for both years.

In general, a significant increase in loan spreads in isolation will result in a fair value decrease for a loan.

EBITDA multiple
EBITDA multiple is the ratio of the valuation of the investment to the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation.

The effect of stressing unobservable inputs to a range of reasonably possible alternatives, alongside considering the impact of using alternative 
models, would be to increase fair values by up to £798m (2018: £961m) or to decrease fair values by up to £1,227m (2018: £1,216m) with 
substantially all the potential effect impacting profit and loss rather than reserves.

Fair value adjustments
Key balance sheet valuation adjustments are quantified below:

Exit price adjustments derived from market bid-offer spreads (429) (457)
Uncollateralised derivative funding (57) (47)
Derivative credit valuation adjustments (135) (125)
Derivative debit valuation adjustments 155 237

Exit price adjustments derived from market bid-offer spreads
The Barclays Group uses mid-market pricing where it is a market maker and has the ability to transact at, or better than, mid price (which is the 
case for certain equity, bond and vanilla derivative markets). For other financial assets and liabilities, bid-offer adjustments are recorded to reflect 
the exit level for the expected close out strategy. The methodology for determining the bid-offer adjustment for a derivative portfolio involves 
calculating the net risk exposure by offsetting long and short positions by strike and term in accordance with the risk management and hedging 
strategy.

Bid-offer levels are generally derived from market quotes such as broker data. Less liquid instruments may not have a directly observable bid-offer 
level. In such instances, an exit price adjustment may be derived from an observable bid-offer level for a comparable liquid instrument, or 
determined by calibrating to derivative prices, or by scenario or historical analysis.

Exit price adjustments derived from market bid-offer spreads have decreased by £28m to £429m as a result of movements in market bid offer 
spreads.

Discounting approaches for derivative instruments 
Collateralised
In line with market practice, the methodology for discounting collateralised derivatives takes into account the nature and currency of the collateral 
that can be posted within the relevant credit support annex (CSA). The CSA aware discounting approach recognises the ‘cheapest to deliver' 
option that reflects the ability of the party posting collateral to change the currency of the collateral.

Uncollateralised
A fair value adjustment of £57m is applied to account for the impact of incorporating the cost of funding into the valuation of uncollateralised and 
partially collateralised derivative portfolios and collateralised derivatives where the terms of the agreement do not allow the rehypothecation of 
collateral received. This adjustment is referred to as the Funding Fair Value Adjustment (FFVA). FFVA has increased by £10m to £57m mainly as a 
result of increase in underlying derivative exposures.

FFVA incorporates a scaling factor which is an estimate of the extent to which the cost of funding is incorporated into observed traded levels. On 
calibrating the scaling factor, it is with the assumption that Credit Valuation Adjustments (CVA) and Debit Valuation Adjustments (DVA) are 
retained as valuation components incorporated into such levels. The effect of incorporating this scaling factor at 31 December 2019 was to reduce 
FFVA by £170m (2018: £141m).

17 Fair value of financial instruments continued
Derivative credit and debit valuation adjustments
CVA and DVA are incorporated into derivative valuations to reflect the impact on fair value of counterparty credit risk and Barclays' own credit 
quality respectively. These adjustments are calculated for uncollateralised and partially collateralised derivatives across all asset classes. CVA and 
DVA are calculated using estimates of exposure at default, probability of default and recovery rates, at a counterparty level. Counterparties include 
(but are not limited to) corporates, sovereigns and sovereign agencies and supranationals.

Exposure at default is generally estimated through the simulation of underlying risk factors through approximating with a more vanilla structure, 
or by using current or scenario-based mark to market as an estimate of future exposure. 

Probability of default and recovery rate information is generally sourced from the CDS markets. Where this information is not available, or 
considered unreliable, alternative approaches are taken based on mapping internal counterparty ratings onto historical or market-based default 
and recovery information. In particular, this applies to sovereign related names where the effect of using the recovery assumptions implied in CDS 
levels would imply a £36m (2018: £50m) increase in CVA.

Correlation between counterparty credit and underlying derivative risk factors, termed ‘wrong-way,' or ‘right-way' risk, is not systematically 
incorporated into the CVA calculation but is adjusted where the underlying exposure is directly related to the counterparty. 

CVA increased by £10m to £135m, as a result of increase in underlying derivative exposures offset by general tightening in Credit Spreads. DVA 
decreased by £82m to £155m, as a result of tightening in Barclays' credit spreads.

Barclays continues to monitor market practices and activity to ensure the approach to uncollateralised derivative valuation remains appropriate.

Portfolio exemptions
The Barclays Group uses the portfolio exemption in IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement to measure the fair value of groups of financial assets and 
liabilities. Instruments are measured using the price that would be received to sell a net long position (i.e. an asset) for a particular risk exposure or 
to transfer a net short position (i.e. a liability) for a particular risk exposure in an orderly transaction between market participants at the balance 
sheet date under current market conditions. Accordingly, the Barclays Group measures the fair value of the group of financial assets and liabilities 
consistently with how market participants would price the net risk exposure at the measurement date.

Unrecognised gains as a result of the use of valuation models using unobservable inputs
The amount that has yet to be recognised in income that relates to the difference between the transaction price (the fair value at initial 
recognition) and the amount that would have arisen had valuation models using unobservable inputs been used on initial recognition, less 
amounts subsequently recognised, is £113m (2018: £141m) for financial instruments measured at fair value and £255m (2018: £262m) for 
financial instruments carried at amortised cost. There are additions of £41m (2018: £65m), and amortisation and releases of £69m (2018: £33m) 
for financial instruments measured at fair value and additions of £7m (2018: £29m) and amortisation and releases of £14m (2018: £20m) for 
financial instruments measured at amortised cost. 

Third party credit enhancements
Structured and brokered certificates of deposit issued by Barclays are insured up to $250,000 per depositor by the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation (FDIC) in the US. The FDIC is funded by premiums that Barclays and other banks pay for deposit insurance coverage. The carrying 
value of these issued certificates of deposit that are designated under the IFRS 9 fair value option includes this third party credit enhancement. 
The on-balance sheet value of these brokered certificates of deposit amounted to £3,218m (2018: £4,797m).

Assets and liabilities held at fair value
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

17 Fair value of financial instruments continued
The fair value is an estimate of the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the measurement date. As a wide range of valuation techniques are available, it may not be appropriate to directly compare 
this fair value information to independent market sources or other financial institutions. Different valuation methodologies and assumptions can 
have a significant impact on fair values which are based on unobservable inputs.

Financial assets
The carrying value of financial assets held at amortised cost is determined in accordance with the relevant accounting policy in Note 19.

Loans and advances at amortised cost
The fair value of loans and advances, for the purpose of this disclosure, is derived from discounting expected cash flows in a way that reflects the 
current market price for lending to issuers of similar credit quality. Where market data or credit information on the underlying borrowers is 
unavailable, a number of proxy/extrapolation techniques are employed to determine the appropriate discount rates.

Reverse repurchase agreements and other similar secured borrowing
The fair value of reverse repurchase agreements approximates carrying amount as these balances are generally short dated and fully collateralised.

Financial liabilities
The carrying value of financial liabilities held at amortised cost is determined in accordance with the accounting policy in Note 1.

Deposits at amortised cost
In many cases, the fair value disclosed approximates carrying value because the instruments are short term in nature or have interest rates that 
reprice frequently, such as customer accounts and other deposits and short-term debt securities.

The fair value for deposits with longer-term maturities, mainly time deposits, are estimated using discounted cash flows applying either market 
rates or current rates for deposits of similar remaining maturities. Consequently, the fair value discount is minimal. 

Repurchase agreements and other similar secured borrowing
The fair value of repurchase agreements approximates carrying amounts as these balances are generally short dated.

Debt securities in issue
Fair values of other debt securities in issue are based on quoted prices where available, or where the instruments are short dated, carrying amount 
approximates fair value. 

Subordinated liabilities
Fair values for dated and undated convertible and non-convertible loan capital are based on quoted market rates for the issuer concerned or 
issuers with similar terms and conditions.

18 Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities
In accordance with IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation, the Group reports financial assets and financial liabilities on a net basis on the 
balance sheet only if there is a legally enforceable right to set-off the recognised amounts and there is intention to settle on a net basis, or to 
realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The following table shows the impact of netting arrangements on:

■■ all financial assets and liabilities that are reported net on the balance sheet
■■ all derivative financial instruments and reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements and other similar secured lending and borrowing 

agreements that are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements, but do not qualify for balance sheet netting.

The ‘Net amounts' presented on the next page are not intended to represent the Group's actual exposure to credit risk, as a variety of credit 
mitigation strategies are employed in addition to netting and collateral arrangements.

a Amounts offset for Derivative financial assets additionally includes cash collateral netted of £4,099m (2018: £2,187m). Amounts offset for Derivative financial liabilities additionally 

includes cash collateral netted of £5,465m (2018: £2,645m). Settlements assets and liabilities have been offset amounting to £14,079m (2018: £23,095m). 
b Financial collateral of £38,922m (2018: £36,904m) was received in respect of derivative assets, including £33,411m (2018: £31,402m) of cash collateral and £5,511m (2018: 

£5,502m) of non-cash collateral. Financial collateral of £38,632m (2018: £32,959m) was placed in respect of derivative liabilities, including £35,712m (2018: £29,842m) of cash 
collateral and £2,920m (2018: £3,117m) of non-cash collateral. The collateral amounts are limited to net balance sheet exposure so as to not include overcollateralisation.

c This column includes contractual rights of set-off that are subject to uncertainty under the laws of the relevant jurisdiction.
d The balance sheet total is the sum of ‘Net amounts reported on the balance sheet' that are subject to enforceable netting arrangements and ‘Amounts not subject to enforceable 

netting arrangements'.
e Reverse repurchase agreements and other similar secured lending of £100,266m (2018: £121,349m) is split by fair value £96,887m (2018: £119,041m) and amortised cost £3,379m 

(2018: £2,308m). Repurchase agreements and other similar secured borrowing of £143,064m (2018: £157,062m) is split by fair value £128,547m (2018: £138,484m) and amortised 
cost £14,517m (2018: £18,578m). 

Derivative assets and liabilities
The ‘Financial instruments' column identifies financial assets and liabilities that are subject to set-off under netting agreements, such as the ISDA 
Master Agreement or derivative exchange or clearing counterparty agreements, whereby all outstanding transactions with the same counterparty 
can be offset and close-out netting applied across all outstanding transactions covered by the agreements if an event of default or other 
predetermined events occur.

Financial collateral refers to cash and non-cash collateral obtained, typically daily or weekly, to cover the net exposure between counterparties by 
enabling the collateral to be realised in an event of default or if other predetermined events occur.

Repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements and other similar secured lending and borrowing
The ‘Amounts offset' column identifies financial assets and liabilities that are subject to set-off under netting agreements, such as Global Master 
Repurchase Agreements and Global Master Securities Lending Agreements, whereby all outstanding transactions with the same counterparty can 
be offset and close-out netting applied across all outstanding transactions covered by the agreements if an event of default or other 
predetermined events occur.

Financial collateral typically comprises highly liquid securities which are legally transferred and can be liquidated in the event of counterparty default.

These offsetting and collateral arrangements and other credit risk mitigation strategies used by the Group are further explained in the Credit risk 
mitigation section on page 139.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Assets at amortised cost 
and other investments

The notes included in this section focus on the Group's loans and advances and deposits at amortised cost, leases, property, plant and 
equipment and goodwill and intangible assets. Details regarding the Group's liquidity and capital position can be found on pages 178 to 197.

19 Loans and advances and deposits at amortised cost

Accounting for loans and advances and deposits held at amortised cost under IFRS 9 effective from 1 January 2018
Loans and advances to customers and banks, customer accounts, debt securities and most financial liabilities, are held at amortised cost. That 
is, the initial fair value (which is normally the amount advanced or borrowed) is adjusted for repayments and the amortisation of coupon, fees 
and expenses to represent the effective interest rate of the asset or liability. Balances deferred on-balance sheet as effective interest rate 
adjustments are amortised to interest income over the life of the financial instrument to which they relate.

Financial assets that are held in a business model to collect the contractual cash flows and that contain contractual terms that give rise on 
specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI, are measured at amortised cost. The carrying value of these financial assets at initial recognition 
includes any directly attributable transaction costs. Refer to Note 1 for details on ‘solely payments of principal and interest'.

In determining whether the business model is a ‘hold to collect' model, the objective of the business model must be to hold the financial asset 
to collect contractual cash flows rather than holding the financial asset for trading or short-term profit taking purposes. While the objective of 
the business model must be to hold the financial asset to collect contractual cash flows this does not mean the Group is required to hold the 
financial assets until maturity. When determining if the business model objective is to collect contractual cash flows the Group will consider 
past sales and expectations about future sales.

Accounting for loans and advances and deposits held at amortised cost under IAS 39 for 2017
Loans and advances to customers and banks, customer accounts, debt securities and most financial liabilities, are held at amortised cost. 
That is, the initial fair value (which is normally the amount advanced or borrowed) is adjusted for repayments and the amortisation of coupon, 
fees and expenses to represent the effective interest rate of the asset or liability. Balances deferred on-balance sheet as effective interest rate 
adjustments are amortised to interest income over the life of the financial instrument to which they relate.

20 Property, plant and equipment

Accounting for property, plant and equipment
The Group applies IAS 16 Property Plant and Equipment and IAS 40 Investment Properties.

Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, which includes direct and incremental acquisition costs less accumulated depreciation and 
provisions for impairment, if required. Subsequent costs are capitalised if these result in enhancement of the asset. 

Depreciation is provided on the depreciable amount of items of property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis over their estimated 
useful economic lives. Depreciation rates, methods and the residual values underlying the calculation of depreciation of items of property, plant 
and equipment are kept under review to take account of any change in circumstances. The Group uses the following annual rates in calculating 
depreciation:

Annual rates in calculating depreciation Depreciation rate 
Freehold land Not depreciated
Freehold buildings and long-leasehold property (more than 50 years to run) 2-3.3%
Leasehold property over the remaining life of the lease (less than 50 years to run) Over the remaining life of the lease 
Costs of adaptation of freehold and leasehold property 6-10%
Equipment installed in freehold and leasehold property 6-10%
Computers and similar equipment 17-33%
Fixtures and fittings and other equipment 9-20%

Costs of adaptation and installed equipment are depreciated over the shorter of the life of the lease or the depreciation rates noted in the 
table above. 

Investment property
The Group initially recognises investment property at cost, and subsequently at fair value at each balance sheet date, reflecting market 
conditions at the reporting date. Gains and losses on remeasurement are included in the income statement.

Note
a Right of use (ROU) asset balances relate to property leases under IFRS 16, which Barclays adopted on 1 January 2019. Refer to Note 21 for further details.

Property rentals of £22m (2018: £19m) have been included in other income.

The fair value of investment property is determined by reference to current market prices for similar properties, adjusted as necessary for condition 
and location, or by reference to recent transactions updated to reflect current economic conditions. Discounted cash flow techniques may be 
employed to calculate fair value where there have been no recent transactions, using current external market inputs such as market rents and 
interest rates. Valuations are carried out by management with the support of appropriately qualified independent valuers. Refer to Note 17 for 
further details.

21 Leases

Accounting for leases under IFRS 16 effective from 1 January 2019
IFRS 16 applies to all leases with the exception of licences of intellectual property, rights held by licencing agreement within the scope of IAS 38 
Intangible Assets, service concession arrangements, leases of biological assets within the scope of IAS 41 Agriculture and leases of minerals, 
oil, natural gas and similar non-regenerative resources. IFRS 16 includes an accounting policy choice for a lessee to elect not to apply IFRS 16 
to remaining assets within the scope of IAS 38 Intangible Assets which the Group has decided to apply. 

When the Group is the lessee, it is required to recognise both:

■■ a lease liability, measured at the present value of remaining cash flows on the lease, and 
■■ a right of use (ROU) asset, measured at the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability, plus any lease payments made prior to 

commencement date, initial direct costs, and estimated costs of restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the lease, less 
any lease incentives received.

Subsequently the lease liability will increase for the accrual of interest, resulting in a constant rate of return throughout the life of the lease, and 
reduce when payments are made. The right of use asset will amortise to the income statement over the life of the lease. The lease liability is 
remeasured when there is a change in one of the following:

■■ future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate
■■ the Group's estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or
■■ the Group's assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option. 

When the lease liability is remeasured, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the ROU asset, or is recorded in the 
income statement if the carrying amount of the ROU asset has been reduced to nil. 

On the balance sheet, the ROU assets are included within property, plant and equipment and the lease liabilities are included within other 
liabilities. 

The Group applies the recognition exemption in IFRS 16 for leases with a term not exceeding 12 months. For these leases the lease payments 
are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term unless another systematic basis is more appropriate. 

When the Group is the lessor, the lease must be classified as either a finance lease or an operating lease. A finance lease is a lease which 
confers substantially all the risks and rewards of the leased assets on the lessee. An operating lease is a lease where substantially all of the risks 
and rewards of the leased asset remain with the lessor. 

When the lease is deemed a finance lease, the leased asset is not held on the balance sheet; instead a finance lease receivable is recognised 
representing the minimum lease payments receivable under the terms of the lease, discounted at the rate of interest implicit in the lease.

When the lease is deemed an operating lease, the lease income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease unless another 
systematic basis is more appropriate. The Group holds the leased assets on-balance sheet within property, plant and equipment. 

Accounting for finance leases under IAS 17 for 2018 and 2017
Under IAS 17, a finance lease is a lease which confers substantially all the risks and rewards of the leased assets on the lessee. Where the Group 
is the lessor, the leased asset is not held on the balance sheet; instead a finance lease receivable is recognised representing the minimum lease 
payments receivable under the terms of the lease, discounted at the rate of interest implicit in the lease. Where the Group is the lessee, the 
leased asset is recognised in property, plant and equipment and a finance lease liability is recognised, representing the minimum lease 
payments payable under the lease, discounted at the rate of interest implicit in the lease.

Interest income or expense is recognised in interest receivable or payable, allocated to accounting periods to reflect a constant periodic rate of 
return.

Accounting for operating leases under IAS 17 for 2018 and 2017
An operating lease under IAS 17 is a lease where substantially all of the risks and rewards of the leased assets remain with the lessor. Where the 
Group is the lessor, lease income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease unless another systematic basis is more 
appropriate. The Group holds the leased assets on-balance sheet within property, plant and equipment.

Where the Group is the lessee, rentals payable are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease 
term unless another systematic basis is more appropriate.

Finance lease income
Finance lease income is included within interest income. The following table shows amounts recognised in the income statement during the year.

As a Lessee 
The Group leases various offices, branches and other premises under non-cancellable lease arrangements to meet its operational business 
requirements. In some instances, Barclays will sublease property to third parties when it is no longer needed to meet business requirements. 
Currently, Barclays does not have any material subleasing arrangements.

ROU asset balances relate to property leases only. Refer to Note 20 for a breakdown of the carrying amount of ROU assets.

The total expenses recognised during the year for short term leases were £14m. The portfolio of short term leases to which Barclays is exposed at

In addition to the cash flows identified above, Barclays is exposed to:

■■ variable lease payments: This variability will typically arise from either inflation index instruments or market based pricing adjustments. 
Currently, Barclays has 939 leases out of the total 1,467 leases which have variable lease payment terms based on market based pricing 
adjustments. Of the gross cash flows identified above, £1,526m is attributable to leases with some degree of variability predominately linked 
to market based pricing adjustments

■■ extension and termination options: The table above represents Barclays best estimate of future cash out flows for leases, including 
assumptions regarding the exercising of contractual extension and termination options. The above gross cash flows have been reduced by 
£474m for leases where Barclays is highly expected to exercise an early termination option. However, there is no significant impact where 
Barclays is expected to exercise an extension option.

The Group currently does not have any significant sale and lease back transactions. The Group does not have any restrictions or covenants 
imposed by the lessor on its property leases which restrict its businesses.

Operating lease commitments under IAS 17 in 2018
In 2018, operating lease rentals of £329m were included in administration and general expenses.

The prior year comparative table for future minimum lease payments by the Group under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows:

22 Goodwill and intangible assets

Accounting for goodwill and intangible assets
Goodwill
The carrying value of goodwill is determined in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations and IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.

Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries represents the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the 
Group's share of the assets acquired and the liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed on the date of the acquisition.

Goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment, or more frequently when there are indications that impairment may have occurred. The test 
involves comparing the carrying value of the cash generating unit (CGU) including goodwill with the present value of the pre-tax cash flows, 
discounted at a rate of interest that reflects the inherent risks, of the CGU to which the goodwill relates, or the CGU's fair value if this is higher. 

Intangible assets
Intangible assets other than goodwill are accounted for in accordance with IAS 38 Intangible Assets.

Intangible assets are initially recognised when they are separable or arise from contractual or other legal rights, the cost can be measured 
reliably and, in the case of intangible assets not acquired in a business combination, where it is probable that future economic benefits 
attributable to the assets will flow from their use.

Intangible assets are stated at cost (which is, in the case of assets acquired in a business combination, the acquisition date fair value) less 
accumulated amortisation and provisions for impairment, if any, and are amortised over their useful lives in a manner that reflects the pattern 
to which they contribute to future cash flows, generally using the amortisation periods set out below:

22 Goodwill and intangible assets continued
Goodwill
Testing goodwill for impairment involves a significant amount of judgement. This includes the identification of independent CGUs and the 
allocation of goodwill to these units based on which units are expected to benefit from the acquisition. Cash flow projections take into account 
changes in the market in which a business operates including the level of growth, competitive activity, and the impacts of regulatory change. The 
estimation of pre-tax cash flows is sensitive to the periods for which detailed forecasts are available and to assumptions regarding long-term 
sustainable cash flows.

Goodwill within Personal Banking was £2,718m (2018: £2,718m), of which £2,501m (2018: £2,501m) was attributable to Woolwich, and within 
Business Banking was £629m (2018: £629m), fully attributable to Woolwich. The carrying value of the CGUs have been determined by using net 
asset values. The recoverable amounts of the CGUs, calculated as value in use, have been determined using cash flow predictions based on 
financial budgets approved by management, covering a five-year period, with a terminal growth rate of 1.5% (2018: 0.0% to 3.5%) applied 
thereafter. The forecasted cash flows have been discounted using a pre-tax rate range of 11.0% to 13.3% (2018: 11.1% to 13.7%). Based on these 
assumptions, the total recoverable amount exceeded the carrying amount including goodwill by £4,551m (2018: £7,762m). A one percentage 
point change in the discount rate or terminal growth rate would increase or decrease the recoverable amount by £1,458m (2018: £1,501m) and 
£968m (2018: £980m) respectively. A reduction in the forecasted cash flows of 15% per annum (2018: 10%) would reduce the recoverable 
amount by £2,534m (2018: £1,828m). Other goodwill of £552m (2018: £560m) was allocated to multiple CGUs which are not considered 
individually significant.

Other intangible assets
Determining the estimated useful lives of intangible assets (such as those arising from contractual relationships) requires an analysis of 
circumstances. The assessment of whether an asset is exhibiting indicators of impairment as well as the calculation of impairment, which requires 
the estimate of future cash flows and fair values less costs to sell, also requires the preparation of cash flow forecasts and fair values for assets that 
may not be regularly bought and sold.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Accruals, provisions, contingent 
liabilities and legal proceedings

The notes included in this section focus on the Group's accruals, provisions and contingent liabilities. Provisions are recognised for present 
obligations arising as consequences of past events where it is probable that a transfer of economic benefit will be necessary to settle the 
obligation, and it can be reliably estimated. Contingent liabilities reflect potential liabilities that are not recognised on the balance sheet.

b Lease liabilities represents the minimum lease payments under the lease, discounted at the rate of interest implicit in the lease.

24 Provisions

Accounting for provisions
The Group applies IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets in accounting for non-financial liabilities.

Provisions are recognised for present obligations arising as consequences of past events where it is more likely than not that a transfer of 
economic benefit will be necessary to settle the obligation, which can be reliably estimated. Provision is made for the anticipated cost of 
restructuring, including redundancy costs when an obligation exists; for example, when the Group has a detailed formal plan for restructuring 
a business and has raised valid expectations in those affected by the restructuring by announcing its main features or starting to implement the 
plan. Provision is made for undrawn loan commitments if it is probable that the facility will be drawn and result in the recognition of an asset at 
an amount less than the amount advanced.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The financial reporting of provisions involves a significant degree of judgement and is complex. Identifying whether a present obligation exists 
and estimating the probability, timing, nature and quantum of the outflows that may arise from past events requires judgements to be made 
based on the specific facts and circumstances relating to individual events and often requires specialist professional advice. When matters are 
at an early stage, accounting judgements and estimates can be difficult because of the high degree of uncertainty involved. Management 
continues to monitor matters as they develop to re-evaluate on an ongoing basis whether provisions should be recognised, however there can 
remain a wide range of possible outcomes and uncertainties, particularly in relation to legal, competition and regulatory matters, and as a 
result it is often not practicable to make meaningful estimates even when matters are at a more advanced stage. 

The complexity of such matters often requires the input of specialist professional advice in making assessments to produce estimates. 
Customer redress and legal, competition and regulatory matters are areas where a higher degree of professional judgement is required. The 
amount that is recognised as a provision can also be very sensitive to the assumptions made in calculating it. This gives rise to a large range of 
potential outcomes which require judgement in determining an appropriate provision level. See below for information on payment protection 
redress and Note 26 for more detail of legal, competition and regulatory matters.

24 Provisions continued
Provisions expected to be recovered or settled within no more than 12 months after 31 December 2019 were £2,457m (2018: £2,144m).

Onerous contracts
Onerous contract provisions comprise an estimate of the costs involved with fulfilling the terms and conditions of contracts net of any expected 
benefits to be received.

Redundancy and restructuring
These provisions comprise the estimated cost of restructuring, including redundancy costs where an obligation exists. Additions made during the 
year relate to formal restructuring plans and have either been utilised, or reversed, where total costs are now expected to be lower than the 
original provision amount.

Undrawn contractually committed facilities and guarantees
Impairment allowance under IFRS 9 considers both the drawn and the undrawn counterparty exposure. For retail portfolios, the total impairment 
allowance is allocated to the drawn exposure to the extent that the allowance does not exceed the exposure as ECL is not reported separately. Any 
excess is reported on the liability side of the balance sheet as a provision. For wholesale portfolios, the impairment allowance on the undrawn 
exposure is reported on the liability side of the balance sheet as a provision. Provisions are made if it is probable that a facility will be drawn and 
the resulting asset is expected to have a realisable value that is less than the amount advanced.

Customer redress
Customer redress provisions comprise the estimated cost of making redress payments to customers, clients and counterparties for losses or 
damages associated with inappropriate judgement in the execution of Barclays Group's business activities. Provisions for other customer redress 
include smaller provisions across the retail and corporate businesses which are expected to be utilised in the next 12-24 months. 

Legal, competition and regulatory matters
The Barclays Group is engaged in various legal proceedings, both in the UK and a number of other overseas jurisdictions, including the US. For 
further information in relation to legal proceedings and discussion of the associated uncertainties, refer to Note 26. 

Sundry provisions
This category includes provisions that do not fit into any of the other categories, such as fraud losses and dilapidation provisions.

Payment Protection Insurance (PPI) redress
As at 31 December 2019, Barclays had recognised cumulative provisions totalling £11bn (December 2018: £9.6bn), against the cost of PPI redress 
and associated processing costs, of which £1.4bn was recognised in Q3 2019. Utilisation of the cumulative provisions to date is £9.8bn (December 
2018: £8.7bn), leaving a residual provision of £1.2bn (December 2018: £0.9bn). This represents Barclays best estimate as at 31 December 2019 
based on the information available.

The current provision reflects the estimated cost of PPI redress attributable to claims and information requests from customers, Claims 
Management Companies and the Official Receiver in relation to bankrupt individuals, prior to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) complaint 
deadline of 29 August 2019.

Q3 2019 saw an exceptional level of claims, enquiries and information requests received in advance of the complaint deadline of 29 August 2019. 
Of the greater than two million items outstanding at Q3 2019, materially all have now been processed into Barclays' systems, 52% of which has 
been resolved including invalid items.

The residual provision has been calculated by applying a number of assumptions to the population of claims and information requests. Based on 
resolution of complaints during Q4 2019, the observed outcomes support the aggregate provision amount.

The following table outlines the key assumptions used in the provision calculation as at 31 December 2019, excluding enquiries from the Official 
Receiver, and a sensitivity analysis illustrating the impact on the provision, if assumptions prove too high or too low.

Assumptions
■■ Validity of claims and information requests received (%) – the proportion of claims and information requests received prior to the FCA 

complaint deadline that are expected to be valid when all processing stages are completed.
■■ Average uphold rate per claim (%) – the expected average uphold rate applied to valid claims where PPI policy/policies exist.
■■ Average claim redress – the expected average payment to customers for upheld valid claims based on the type and age of the policy/

policies (£).

the provision level, inclusive of operational processing costs.

b Total valid information requests received, excluding those for which no PPI policy exists, enquiries from the Official Receiver in relation to bankrupt individuals and responses to

c Average uphold rate per claim, excluding those for which no PPI policy exists, enquiries from the Official Receiver in relation to bankrupt individuals and responses to proactive

d Average redress stated on a per policy basis for valid claims received by Barclays excluding enquiries from the Official Receiver in relation to bankrupt individuals and responses to 
proactive mailing. The sensitivity analysis has been calculated to show the impact a £100 increase or decrease in the average redress per claim would have on the provision level.

e Based on recently observed data, August to December 2019.
f Based on annual observed rate to September 2019. No material change observed to December 2019.

These assumptions remain subjective due to the uncertainty associated with the outstanding population of claims and information requests yet to 
be resolved. It is possible that the eventual cumulative provision may differ from the current estimate.

The estimate related to enquiries received from the Official Receiver is subject to additional uncertainty and sensitivity as the legal position; uphold 
rates and average claim redress may differ from those experienced more generally, given the particular circumstances of this population. The 
range of uncertainty is not material in the context of the total provision.

25 Contingent liabilities and commitments

Accounting for contingent liabilities
Contingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will be confirmed only by uncertain future events, and present obligations where 
the transfer of economic resources is uncertain or cannot be reliably measured. Contingent liabilities are not recognised on the balance sheet 
but are disclosed unless the likelihood of an outflow of economic resources is remote.

The following table summarises the nominal principal amount of contingent liabilities and commitments which are not recorded on-balance sheet:

2019
£m

2018
£m

Guarantees and letters of credit pledged as collateral security 17,606 15,805
Performance guarantees, acceptances and endorsements 6,921 4,498
Total contingent liabilities 24,527 20,303
Of which: Financial guarantees carried at fair value 43 4

Documentary credits and other short-term trade related transactions 1,291 1,741
Standby facilities, credit lines and other commitments 333,164 322,482
Total commitments 334,455 324,223
Of which: Loan commitments carried at fair value 17,679 11,723

Provisions held against contingent liabilities and commitments equal £322m (2018: £271m).

26 Legal, competition and regulatory matters 
Members of the Group face legal, competition and regulatory challenges, many of which are beyond our control. The extent of the impact of these 
matters cannot always be predicted but may materially impact our operations, financial results, condition and prospects. Matters arising from a set 
of similar circumstances can give rise to either a contingent liability or a provision, or both, depending on the relevant facts and circumstances. 

The recognition of provisions in relation to such matters involves critical accounting estimates and judgements in accordance with the relevant 
accounting policies as described in Note 24, Provisions. We have not disclosed an estimate of the potential financial impact or effect on the Group 
of contingent liabilities where it is not currently practicable to do so. Various matters detailed in this note seek damages of an unspecified amount. 
While certain matters specify the damages claimed, such claimed amounts do not necessarily reflect the Group's potential financial exposure in 
respect of those matters. 

Matters are ordered under headings corresponding to the financial statements in which they are disclosed. 

1. Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC
Investigations into certain advisory services agreements and other matters and civil action 
FCA proceedings 
In 2008, Barclays Bank PLC and Qatar Holdings LLC entered into two advisory service agreements (the Agreements). The Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA), is conducting an investigation into whether the Agreements may have related to Barclays PLC's capital raisings in June and 
November 2008 (the Capital Raisings) and therefore should have been disclosed in the announcements or public documents relating to the 
Capital Raisings. In 2013, the FCA issued warning notices (the Notices) finding that Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC acted recklessly and in 
breach of certain disclosure-related listing rules, and that Barclays PLC was also in breach of Listing Principle 3. The financial penalty provided in 
the Notices is £50m. Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC continue to contest the findings. The FCA action has been stayed due to the UK Serious 
Fraud Office (SFO) proceedings pending against certain former Barclays executives. All charges brought by the SFO against Barclays PLC and 
Barclays Bank PLC in relation to the Agreements were dismissed in 2018.

Civil action 
PCP Capital Partners LLP and PCP International Finance Limited (PCP) are seeking damages of approximately £1.6bn from Barclays Bank PLC for 
fraudulent misrepresentation and deceit, arising from alleged statements made by Barclays Bank PLC to PCP in relation to the terms on which 
securities were to be issued to potential investors, allegedly including PCP, in the November 2008 capital raising. Barclays Bank PLC is defending 
the claim and trial is scheduled to commence in June 2020.

Investigation into historic hiring practices 
In 2019, Barclays PLC reached a settlement of $6.4m with the US Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) in relation to certain of its hiring 
practices in Asia, resolving this matter. 

Investigations into LIBOR and other benchmarks and related civil actions 
Regulators and law enforcement agencies, including certain competition authorities, from a number of governments have been conducting 
investigations relating to Barclays Bank PLC's involvement in allegedly manipulating certain financial benchmarks, such as LIBOR. The SFO has 
closed its investigation with no action to be taken against the Group. Various individuals and corporates in a range of jurisdictions have threatened 
or brought civil actions against the Group and other banks in relation to the alleged manipulation of LIBOR and/or other benchmarks. Certain 
actions remain pending.

USD LIBOR civil actions
The majority of the USD LIBOR cases, which have been filed in various US jurisdictions, have been consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the US 
District Court in the Southern District of New York (SDNY). The complaints are substantially similar and allege, among other things, that Barclays 
PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, Barclays Capital Inc. (BCI) and other financial institutions individually and collectively violated provisions of the US 
Sherman Antitrust Act (Antitrust Act), the US Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), the US Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act 
(RICO), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and various state laws by manipulating USD LIBOR rates.

Putative class actions and individual actions seek unspecified damages with the exception of five lawsuits, in which the plaintiffs are seeking a 
combined total in excess of $1.25bn in actual damages and additional punitive damages against all defendants, including Barclays Bank PLC. 
Some of the lawsuits also seek trebling of damages under the Antitrust Act and RICO. Barclays has previously settled certain claims. Two of the 
class action settlements where Barclays has paid $20m and $7.1m, respectively, remain subject to final court approval and/or the right of class 
members to opt out of the settlement to file their own claims.

Sterling LIBOR civil actions
In 2016, two putative class actions filed in the SDNY against Barclays Bank PLC, BCI and other Sterling LIBOR panel banks alleging, among other 
things, that the defendants manipulated the Sterling LIBOR rate in violation of the Antitrust Act, CEA and RICO, were consolidated. The 
defendants' motion to dismiss the claims was granted in December 2018. The plaintiffs have appealed the dismissal.

Japanese Yen LIBOR civil actions
In 2012, a putative class action was filed in the SDNY against Barclays Bank PLC and other Japanese Yen LIBOR panel banks by a lead plaintiff 
involved in exchange-traded derivatives and members of the Japanese Bankers Association's Euroyen Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate (Euroyen 
TIBOR) panel. The complaint alleges, among other things, manipulation of the Euroyen TIBOR and Yen LIBOR rates and breaches of the CEA and 
the Antitrust Act. In 2014, the court dismissed the plaintiff 's antitrust claims in full, but the plaintiff 's CEA claims remain pending.

In 2015, a second putative class action, making similar allegations to the above class action, was filed in the SDNY against Barclays PLC, Barclays 
Bank PLC and BCI. In 2017, this action was dismissed in full and the plaintiffs have appealed the dismissal.

26 Legal, competition and regulatory matters continued 
SIBOR/SOR civil action 
In 2016, a putative class action was filed in the SDNY against Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, BCI and other defendants, alleging manipulation of 
the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate (SIBOR) and Singapore Swap Offer Rate (SOR). In October 2018, the court dismissed all claims against 
Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC and BCI. The plaintiffs have appealed the dismissal. 

ICE LIBOR civil actions
In 2019, several putative class actions have been filed in the SDNY against Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, BCI, other financial institution 
defendants and Intercontinental Exchange Inc. and certain of its affiliates (ICE), asserting antitrust claims that defendants manipulated USD LIBOR 
through defendants' submissions to ICE. These actions have been consolidated. The defendants have filed a motion to dismiss.

Non-US benchmarks civil actions 
Legal proceedings (which include the claims referred to below in ‘Local authority civil actions concerning LIBOR') have been brought or threatened 
against Barclays Bank PLC (and, in certain cases, Barclays Bank UK PLC) in the UK in connection with alleged manipulation of LIBOR, EURIBOR and 
other benchmarks. Proceedings have also been brought in a number of other jurisdictions in Europe and Israel. Additional proceedings in other 
jurisdictions may be brought in the future.

Foreign Exchange investigations and related civil actions 
In 2015, the Group reached settlements totalling approximately $2.38bn with various US federal and state authorities and the FCA in relation to 
investigations into certain sales and trading practices in the Foreign Exchange market. Under the related plea agreement with the US Department 
of Justice (DoJ), which received final court approval in January 2017, the Group agreed to a term of probation of three years. The Group also 
continues to provide relevant information to certain authorities. 

The European Commission is one of a number of authorities still conducting an investigation into certain trading practices in Foreign Exchange 
markets. The European Commission announced two settlements in May 2019 and the Group paid penalties totalling approximately €210m. In June 
2019, the Swiss Competition Commission announced two settlements and the Group paid penalties totalling approximately CHF 27m. The 
financial impact of the ongoing matters is not expected to be material to the Group's operating results, cash flows or financial position.

A number of individuals and corporates in a range of jurisdictions have also threatened or brought civil actions against the Group and other banks 
in relation to alleged manipulation of Foreign Exchange markets, and may do so in the future. Certain actions remain pending. 

FX opt out civil action 
In 2018, Barclays Bank PLC and BCI settled a consolidated action filed in the SDNY, alleging manipulation of Foreign Exchange markets 
(Consolidated FX Action), for a total amount of $384m. Also in 2018, a group of plaintiffs who opted out of the Consolidated FX Action filed a 
complaint in the SDNY against Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, BCI and other defendants. 

Retail basis civil action 
In 2015, a putative class action was filed against several international banks, including Barclays PLC and BCI, on behalf of a proposed class of 
individuals who exchanged currencies on a retail basis at bank branches (Retail Basis Claims). The SDNY has ruled that the Retail Basis Claims are 
not covered by the settlement agreement in the Consolidated FX Action. The Court subsequently dismissed all Retail Basis Claims against the 
Group and all other defendants. The plaintiffs have filed an amended complaint.

State law FX civil action 
In 2017, the SDNY dismissed consolidated putative class actions brought under federal and various state laws on behalf of proposed classes of (i) 
stockholders of Exchange Traded Funds and others who purportedly were indirect investors in FX instruments, and (ii) investors who traded FX 
instruments through FX dealers or brokers not alleged to have manipulated Foreign Exchange Rates. The plaintiffs' amended complaint as to their 
state law claims is pending.

Non-US FX civil actions
In addition to the actions described above, legal proceedings have been brought or are threatened against Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, BCI 
and Barclays Execution Services Limited (BX) in connection with alleged manipulation of Foreign Exchange in the UK, a number of other 
jurisdictions in Europe, Israel and Australia and additional proceedings may be brought in the future.

Metals investigations and related civil actions 
Barclays Bank PLC previously provided information to the DoJ, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission and other authorities in 
connection with investigations into metals and metals-based financial instruments. 

A number of US civil complaints, each on behalf of a proposed class of plaintiffs, have been consolidated and transferred to the SDNY. The 
complaints allege that Barclays Bank PLC and other members of The London Gold Market Fixing Ltd. manipulated the prices of gold and gold 
derivative contracts in violation of US antitrust and other federal laws. This consolidated putative class action remains pending. A separate US civil 
complaint by a proposed class of plaintiffs against a number of banks, including Barclays Bank PLC, BCI and BX (formerly, Barclays Capital Services 
Limited), alleging manipulation of the price of silver in violation of the CEA, the Antitrust Act and state antitrust and consumer protection laws, 
has been dismissed as against the Barclays entities. The plaintiffs have the option to seek the court's permission to appeal.

26 Legal, competition and regulatory matters continued 
US residential mortgage related civil actions 
There are various pending civil actions relating to US Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities (RMBS), including four actions arising from 
unresolved repurchase requests submitted by Trustees for certain RMBS, alleging breaches of various loan-level representations and warranties 
(R&Ws) made by Barclays Bank PLC and/or a subsidiary acquired in 2007 (the Acquired Subsidiary). The unresolved repurchase requests received 
as at 31 December 2019 had an original unpaid principal balance of approximately $2.1bn. The Trustees have also alleged that the relevant R&Ws 
may have been breached with respect to a greater (but unspecified) amount of loans than previously stated in the unresolved repurchase requests. 

These repurchase actions are ongoing. In one repurchase action, the New York Court of Appeals held that claims related to certain R&Ws are 
time-barred. Barclays Bank PLC has reached a settlement to resolve two of the repurchase actions, which is subject to final court approval. The 
financial impact of the settlement is not expected to be material to the Group's operating results, cash flows or financial position. The remaining 
two repurchase actions are pending.

Government and agency securities civil actions and related matters
Certain governmental authorities are conducting investigations into activities relating to the trading of certain government and agency securities 
in various markets. The Group provided information in cooperation with such investigations. Civil actions have also been filed on the basis of 
similar allegations, as described below.

Treasury auction securities civil actions
Consolidated putative class action complaints filed in the US Federal Court against Barclays Bank PLC, BCI and other financial institutions under 
the Antitrust Act and state common law allege that the defendants (i) conspired to manipulate the US Treasury securities market and/or (ii) 
conspired to prevent the creation of certain platforms by boycotting or threatening to boycott such trading platforms. The defendants have filed a 
motion to dismiss.

In addition, certain plaintiffs have filed a related, direct action against BCI and certain other financial institutions, alleging that defendants 
conspired to fix and manipulate the US Treasury securities market in violation of the Antitrust Act, the CEA and state common law.

Supranational, Sovereign and Agency bonds civil actions
Civil antitrust actions have been filed in the SDNY and Federal Court of Canada in Toronto against Barclays Bank PLC, BCI, BX (formerly, Barclays 
Services Limited), Barclays Capital Securities Limited and, with respect to the civil action filed in Canada only, Barclays Capital Canada, Inc. and 
other financial institutions alleging that the defendants conspired to fix prices and restrain competition in the market for US dollar-denominated 
Supranational, Sovereign and Agency bonds. 

In one of the actions filed in the SDNY, the court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' complaint with respect to Barclays Bank 
PLC and certain Group entities. Defendants have filed a motion to dismiss those plaintiffs' remaining claims against BCI. The remaining action filed 
in the SDNY is stayed.

Variable Rate Demand Obligations civil actions
Civil actions have been filed against Barclays Bank PLC and BCI and other financial institutions alleging the defendants conspired or colluded to 
artificially inflate interest rates set for Variable Rate Demand Obligations (VRDOs). VRDOs are municipal bonds with interest rates that reset on a 
periodic basis, most commonly weekly. Two actions in state court have been filed by private plaintiffs on behalf of the states of Illinois and 
California. Two putative class action complaints, which have been consolidated, have been filed in the SDNY.

Government bond civil actions
In a putative class action filed in the SDNY in 2019, plaintiffs alleged that BCI and certain other bond dealers conspired to fix the prices of US 
government sponsored entity bonds in violation of US antitrust law. BCI has agreed a settlement of $87m, subject to court approval. In 2019, the 
Louisiana Attorney General and the City of Baton Rouge each filed a complaint against Barclays Bank PLC and other financial institutions making 
similar allegations as the class action plaintiffs.

In 2018, a separate putative class action against various financial institutions including Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, BCI, Barclays Bank Mexico, 
S.A., and certain other subsidiaries of the Group was consolidated in the SDNY. The plaintiffs asserted antitrust and state law claims arising out of 
an alleged conspiracy to fix the prices of Mexican Government bonds. Barclays PLC has settled the claim, subject to court approval. The financial 
impact of the settlement is not material to the Group's operating results, cash flows or financial position.

BDC Finance L.L.C. 
In 2008, BDC Finance L.L.C. (BDC) filed a complaint in the NY Supreme Court, demanding damages of $298m, alleging that Barclays Bank PLC had 
breached a contract in connection with a portfolio of total return swaps governed by an ISDA Master Agreement (collectively, the Agreement). 
Following a trial on certain liability issues, the court ruled in December 2018 that Barclays Bank PLC was not a defaulting party, which was affirmed 
on appeal.

In 2011, BDC's investment advisor, BDCM Fund Adviser, L.L.C. and its parent company, Black Diamond Capital Holdings, L.L.C. also sued Barclays 
Bank PLC and BCI in Connecticut State Court for unspecified damages allegedly resulting from Barclays Bank PLC's conduct relating to the 
Agreement, asserting claims for violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act and tortious interference with business and prospective 
business relations. This case is currently stayed.

Civil actions in respect of the US Anti-Terrorism Act 
There are a number of civil actions, on behalf of more than 4,000 plaintiffs, filed in US federal courts in the US District Court in the Eastern District 
of New York (EDNY) and SDNY against Barclays Bank PLC and a number of other banks. The complaints generally allege that Barclays Bank PLC 
and those banks engaged in a conspiracy to facilitate US dollar-denominated transactions for the Government of Iran and various Iranian banks, 
which in turn funded acts of terrorism that injured or killed plaintiffs or plaintiffs' family members. The plaintiffs seek to recover damages for pain, 
suffering and mental anguish under the provisions of the US Anti-Terrorism Act, which allow for the trebling of any proven damages.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Accruals, provisions, contingent 
liabilities and legal proceedings
26 Legal, competition and regulatory matters continued 
The court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss one action in the EDNY, and plaintiffs have filed a notice of appeal. The defendants have 
moved to dismiss two other EDNY actions. The court also granted the defendants' motion to dismiss another action in the SDNY, but the plaintiffs 
have moved to file an amended complaint. The remaining actions are stayed pending decisions in these cases. 

Interest rate swap and credit default swap US civil actions 
Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC and BCI, together with other financial institutions that act as market makers for interest rate swaps (IRS) are 
named as defendants in several antitrust class actions which were consolidated in the SDNY in 2016. The complaints allege the defendants 
conspired to prevent the development of exchanges for IRS and demand unspecified money damages. 

In 2018, trueEX LLC filed an antitrust class action in the SDNY against a number of financial institutions including Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC 
and BCI based on similar allegations with respect to trueEX LLC's development of an IRS platform. In 2017, Tera Group Inc. filed a separate civil 
antitrust action in the SDNY claiming that certain conduct alleged in the IRS cases also caused the plaintiff to suffer harm with respect to the 
Credit Default Swaps market. In November 2018 and July 2019, respectively, the court dismissed certain claims in both cases for unjust enrichment 
and tortious interference but denied motions to dismiss the federal and state antitrust claims, which remain pending.

Portuguese Competition Authority investigation 
The Portuguese Competition Authority found that a subsidiary of Barclays Bank PLC and other banks violated competition law by exchanging 
information about retail credit products relating to mortgages, consumer lending and lending to small and medium enterprises. The Group 
applied for immunity and received no fine. 

2. Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Bank UK PLC
Investigation into collections and recoveries relating to unsecured lending 
Since February 2018, the FCA has been investigating whether the Group implemented effective systems and controls with respect to collections and 
recoveries and whether it paid due consideration to the interests of customers in default and arrears. The FCA investigation is at an advanced stage.

HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) assessments concerning UK Value Added Tax 
In 2018, HMRC issued notices that have the effect of removing certain overseas subsidiaries that have operations in the UK from Barclays' UK VAT 
Group, in which Group supplies between members are generally free from VAT. The notices have retrospective effect and correspond to 
assessments of £181m (inclusive of interest), of which Barclays would expect to attribute an amount of approximately £128m to Barclays Bank UK 
PLC and £53m to Barclays Bank PLC. HMRC's decision has been appealed to the First Tier Tribunal (Tax Chamber).

Local authority civil actions concerning LIBOR 
Following settlement by Barclays Bank PLC of various governmental investigations concerning certain benchmark interest rate submissions 
referred to above in ‘Investigations into LIBOR and other benchmarks and related civil actions', in the UK, certain local authorities have brought 
claims against Barclays Bank PLC (and, in certain cases, Barclays Bank UK PLC) asserting that they entered into loans in reliance on 
misrepresentations made by Barclays Bank PLC in respect of its conduct in relation to LIBOR. Barclays has applied to strike out the claims.

General
The Group is engaged in various other legal, competition and regulatory matters in the UK, the US and a number of other overseas jurisdictions. 
It is subject to legal proceedings brought by and against the Group which arise in the ordinary course of business from time to time, including 
(but not limited to) disputes in relation to contracts, securities, debt collection, consumer credit, fraud, trusts, client assets, competition, data 
management and protection, money laundering, financial crime, employment, environmental and other statutory and common law issues.

The Group is also subject to enquiries and examinations, requests for information, audits, investigations and legal and other proceedings by 
regulators, governmental and other public bodies in connection with (but not limited to) consumer protection measures, compliance with 
legislation and regulation, wholesale trading activity and other areas of banking and business activities in which the Group is or has been engaged. 
The Group is cooperating with the relevant authorities and keeping all relevant agencies briefed as appropriate in relation to these matters and 
others described in this note on an ongoing basis.

At the present time, Barclays PLC does not expect the ultimate resolution of any of these other matters to have a material adverse effect on the 
Group's financial position. However, in light of the uncertainties involved in such matters and the matters specifically described in this note, there 
can be no assurance that the outcome of a particular matter or matters (including formerly active matters or those matters arising after the date 
of this note) will not be material to Barclays PLC's results, operations or cash flow for a particular period, depending on, among other things, the 
amount of the loss resulting from the matter(s) and the amount of profit otherwise reported for the reporting period.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

27 Subordinated liabilities continued
Interest
The Junior Undated Notes are floating rate notes where rates are fixed periodically in advance based on the related interbank rate. 

Payment of interest
No payment of principal or any interest may be made in relation to the TONs and RCIs unless Barclays Bank PLC satisfies a specified solvency test.

Barclays Bank PLC may elect to defer any payment of interest on the RCIs. Any such deferred payment of interest must be paid on the earlier of: (i) 
the date of redemption of the RCIs, and (ii) the coupon payment date falling on or nearest to the tenth anniversary of the date of deferral of such 
payment. While such deferral is continuing, neither Barclays Bank PLC nor Barclays PLC may (i) declare or pay a dividend, subject to certain 
exceptions, on any of its ordinary shares or preference shares and (ii) certain restrictions on the redemption, purchase or reduction of their 
respective share capital and certain other securities also apply.

Barclays Bank PLC may elect to defer any payment of interest on the TONs if it determines that it is, or such payment would result in it being, in 
non-compliance with capital adequacy requirements and policies of the PRA. Any such deferred payment of interest will only be payable on a 
redemption of the TONs. Until such time as Barclays Bank PLC next makes a payment of interest on the TONs, neither Barclays Bank PLC nor 
Barclays PLC may (i) declare or pay a dividend, subject to certain exceptions, on any of their respective ordinary shares or preference shares, or 
make payments of interest in respect of Barclays Bank PLC's Reserve Capital Instruments and (ii) certain restrictions on the redemption, purchase 
or reduction of their respective share capital and certain other securities also apply. 

Repayment
All undated subordinated liabilities are repayable at the option of Barclays Bank PLC, generally in whole, at the initial call date and on any 
subsequent coupon or interest payment date. In addition, each issue of undated subordinated liabilities is repayable, at the option of Barclays Bank 
PLC in whole for certain tax reasons, either at any time, or on an interest payment date. There are no events of default except non-payment of 
principal or mandatory interest. Any repayments require the prior approval of the PRA.

Other
All issues of undated subordinated liabilities are non-convertible.

27 Subordinated liabilities continued

Dated subordinated liabilities
Dated subordinated liabilities are issued by Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC and respective subsidiaries for the development and expansion of their 
business and to strengthen their respective capital bases. The principal terms of the dated subordinated liabilities are described below:

Subordination
Dated subordinated liabilities issued by Barclays PLC ranks behind the claims against Barclays PLC of unsecured unsubordinated creditors but 
before the claims of the holders of its equity.

All dated subordinated liabilities externally issued by Barclays Bank PLC rank behind the claims against the bank of depositors and other unsecured 
unsubordinated creditors but before the claims of the undated subordinated liabilities and the holders of its equity. The dated subordinated 
liabilities externally issued by other subsidiaries are similarly subordinated as the external subordinated liabilities issued by Barclays Bank PLC. 

Interest
Interest on the Floating Rate Notes is fixed periodically in advance, based on the related interbank or local central bank rates. 

Interest on the 2.625% Fixed Rate Subordinated Callable Notes, 4.836% Fixed Rate Subordinated Callable Notes, 2% Fixed Rate Subordinated 
Callable Notes and the 3.75% Fixed Rate Resetting Subordinated Callable Notes are fixed until the call date. After the respective call dates, in the 
event that they are not redeemed, the interest rates will be reset and fixed until maturity based on a market rate. Interest on the 5.088% Fixed-to-
Floating Rate Subordinated Callable Notes are fixed until the call date. After the call date, in the event that they are not redeemed, the interest rate 
will reset periodically in advance based on USD London interbank rates.

Repayment
Those subordinated liabilities with a call date are repayable at the option of the issuer, on conditions governing the respective debt obligations, 
some in whole or in part, and some only in whole. The remaining dated subordinated liabilities outstanding at 31 December 2019 are redeemable 
only on maturity, subject in particular cases to provisions allowing an early redemption in the event of certain changes in tax law, or to certain 
changes in legislation or regulations. 

Any repayments prior to maturity require, in the case of Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC, the prior approval of the PRA, or in the case of the 
overseas issues, the approval of the local regulator for that jurisdiction and of the PRA in certain circumstances.

There are no committed facilities in existence at the balance sheet date which permit the refinancing of debt beyond the date of maturity.

Other
The 7.625% Contingent Capital Notes will be automatically transferred from investors to Barclays PLC (or another entity within the Group) for nil 
consideration in the event the Barclays PLC consolidated CRD IV CET1 ratio (FSA October 2012 transitional statement) falls below 7%.

The principal terms of the AT1 securities are described below:

■■ AT1 securities rank behind the claims against Barclays PLC of 1) unsubordinated creditors; 2) claims which are expressed to be subordinated 
to the claims of unsubordinated creditors of Barclays PLC but not further or otherwise; or 3) claims which are, or are expressed to be, junior to 
the claims of other creditors of Barclays PLC, whether subordinated or unsubordinated, other than claims which rank, or are expressed to rank, 
pari passu with, or junior to, the claims of holders of the AT1 securities.

■■ AT1 securities bear a fixed rate of interest until the initial call date. After the initial call date, in the event that they are not redeemed, the AT1 
securities will bear interest at rates fixed periodically in advance for five-year periods based on market rates.

■■ Interest on the AT1 securities will be due and payable only at the sole discretion of Barclays PLC, and Barclays PLC has sole and absolute 
discretion at all times and for any reason to cancel (in whole or in part) any interest payment that would otherwise be payable on any interest 
payment date.

■■ AT1 securities are undated and are redeemable, at the option of Barclays PLC, in whole but not in part at the initial call date, or on any fifth 
anniversary after the initial call date. In addition, the AT1 securities are redeemable, at the option of Barclays PLC, in whole in the event of 
certain changes in the tax or regulatory treatment of the securities. Any redemptions require the prior consent of the PRA.

All AT1 securities will be converted into ordinary shares of Barclays PLC, at a pre-determined price, should the fully loaded CET1 ratio of the Group 
fall below 7%.

£8m. Further detail can be found in Note 1.

Barclays Bank PLC and protective rights of non-controlling interests
Barclays PLC holds 100% of the voting rights of Barclays Bank PLC. As at 31 December 2019, Barclays Bank PLC has in issue preference shares and 
Upper Tier 2 instruments. These are non-controlling interests to the Group. 

A fixed coupon rate is attached to all Upper Tier 2 instruments until the initial call date, with the exception of the 9% Bonds, which are fixed for the 
life of the issue and the Series 1, Series 2 and Series 3 Undated Notes, which are floating rate at rates fixed periodically in advance based on market 
rates.

After the initial call date, in the event they are not redeemed, coupon payments in relation to the 7.125%, 6.125% Undated Notes, and the 9.25% 
Bonds are fixed periodically in advance for five-year periods based on market rates. Coupon payments for all other Upper Tier 2 instruments are at 
rates fixed periodically in advance based on market rates.

Capital instruments,  
equity and reserves
30 Non-controlling interests continued
The payment of preference share dividends and Upper Tier 2 coupons are typically at the discretion of Barclays Bank PLC, except for coupon 
payments that become compulsory where Barclays PLC has declared or paid a dividend on ordinary shares, or in certain cases, any class of 
preference shares, in the preceding six-month period. Barclays Bank PLC is not obliged to make a payment of interest on its 9.25% Perpetual 
Subordinated Bonds if, in the immediately preceding 12-month interest period, a dividend has not been paid on any class of its share capital. 
Coupons not paid becomes payable in each case if such a dividend is subsequently paid or in certain other circumstances. No dividend or coupon 
payments may be made unless Barclays Bank PLC satisfies a specified solvency test. Under the terms of these instruments, Barclays PLC may not 
pay dividends on ordinary shares until a dividend or coupon is next paid on these instruments or the instruments are redeemed or purchased by 
Barclays Bank PLC. There are no restrictions on Barclays Bank PLC's ability to remit capital to the Parent as a result of these issued instruments.

Preference share redemptions are typically at the discretion of Barclays Bank PLC. Upper Tier 2 instruments are repayable, at the option of Barclays 
Bank PLC generally in whole at the initial call date and on any subsequent coupon payment date or, in the case of the 7.125%, 6.125% Undated 
Notes and the 9.25% Perpetual Bonds, on any fifth anniversary after the initial call date. In addition, each issue of Upper Tier 2 instruments is 
repayable, at the option of Barclays Bank PLC, in whole for certain tax reasons, either at any time, or on an interest payment date. There are no 
events of default except non-payment of principal or mandatory interest. Any repayments or redemptions require the prior approval of the PRA, 
and in respect of the preference shares, any such redemption will be subject to the Companies Act 2006 and the Articles of Barclays Bank PLC.

Employee benefits

The notes included in this section focus on the costs and commitments associated with employing our staff.

31 Staff costs

Accounting for staff costs
The Group applies IAS 19 Employee benefits in its accounting for most of the components of staff costs.

Short-term employee benefits – salaries, accrued performance costs and social security are recognised over the period in which the employees 
provide the services to which the payments relate.

Performance costs – recognised to the extent that the Group has a present obligation to its employees that can be measured reliably and are 
recognised over the period of service that employees are required to work to qualify for the payments.

Deferred cash and share awards are made to employees to incentivise performance over the period employees provide services. To receive 
payment under an award, employees must provide service over the vesting period. The period over which the expense for deferred cash and 
share awards is recognised is based upon the period employees consider their services contribute to the awards. For past awards, the Group 
considers that it is appropriate to recognise the awards over the period from the date of grant to the date that the awards vest. In relation to 
awards granted from 2017, the Group, taking into account the changing employee understanding surrounding those awards, considered it 
appropriate for expense to be recognised over the vesting period including the financial year prior to the grant date. 

The accounting policies for share-based payments, and pensions and other post-retirement benefits are included in Note 32 and Note 33 
respectively.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

32 Share-based payments 

Accounting for share-based payments
The Group applies IFRS 2 Share-based Payments in accounting for employee remuneration in the form of shares. 

Employee incentives include awards in the form of shares and share options, as well as offering employees the opportunity to purchase shares on 
favourable terms. The cost of the employee services received in respect of the shares or share options granted is recognised in the income 
statement over the period that employees provide services. The overall cost of the award is calculated using the number of shares and options 
expected to vest and the fair value of the shares or options at the date of grant. 

The number of shares and options expected to vest takes into account the likelihood that performance and service conditions included in the 
terms of the awards will be met. Failure to meet the non-vesting condition is treated as a cancellation, resulting in an acceleration of recognition of 
the cost of the employee services.

The fair value of shares is the market price ruling on the grant date, in some cases adjusted to reflect restrictions on transferability. The fair value 
of options granted is determined using option pricing models to estimate the numbers of shares likely to vest. These take into account the 
exercise price of the option, the current share price, the risk-free interest rate, the expected volatility of the share price over the life of the option 
and other relevant factors. Market conditions that must be met in order for the award to vest are also reflected in the fair value of the award, as are 
any other non-vesting conditions – such as continuing to make payments into a share-based savings scheme. 

The charge for the year arising from share-based payment schemes was as follows:

Cash settled 3 1 3
Total share-based payments 481 450 508

The terms of the main current plans are as follows:

Share Value Plan (SVP)
The SVP was introduced in March 2010. SVP awards have been granted to participants in the form of a conditional right to receive Barclays PLC 
shares or provisional allocations of Barclays PLC shares which vest or are considered for release over a period of three, five or seven years. 
Participants do not pay to receive an award or to receive a release of shares. For awards granted before December 2017, the grantor may also make 
a dividend equivalent payment to participants on release of a SVP award. SVP awards are also made to eligible employees for recruitment 
purposes. All awards are subject to potential forfeiture in certain leaver scenarios.

Deferred Share Value Plan (DSVP)
The DSVP was introduced in February 2017. The terms of the DSVP are materially the same as the terms of the SVP as described above, save that 
Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in the DSVP and the DSVP operates over market purchase shares only.

Other schemes 
In addition to the SVP and DSVP, the Barclays Group operates a number of other schemes settled in Barclays PLC Shares including Sharesave (both 
UK and Ireland), Sharepurchase (both UK and overseas), and the Barclays Group Long Term Incentive Plan. A delivery of upfront shares to 
‘Material Risk Takers' can be made as a Share Incentive Award (Holding Period).

Awards and options granted under the Group's share plans may be satisfied using new issue shares, treasury shares and market purchase shares. 
Awards granted under the DSVP may be satisfied using market purchase shares only.

There were no significant modifications to the share-based payments arrangements in 2019 and 2018.

As at 31 December 2019, the total liability arising from cash-settled share-based payments transactions was £3m (2018: £2m).

Holdings of Barclays PLC shares
Various employee benefit trusts established by the Group hold shares in Barclays PLC to meet obligations under the Barclays share-based payment 
schemes. The total number of Barclays shares held in these employee benefit trusts at 31 December 2019 was 13.1m (2018: 11.4m). Dividend 
rights have been waived on all these shares. The total market value of the shares held in trust based on the year-end share price of £1.80 (2018: 
£1.51) was £24m (2018: £17m). For accounting of treasury shares, see Note 29.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Employee benefits

33 Pensions and post-retirement benefits

Accounting for pensions and post-retirement benefits
The Group operates a number of pension schemes and post-employment benefit schemes.

Defined contribution schemes – the Group recognises contributions due in respect of the accounting period in the income statement. 
Any contributions unpaid at the balance sheet date are included as a liability.

Defined benefit schemes – the Group recognises its obligations to members of each scheme at the period end, less the fair value of the scheme 
assets after applying the asset ceiling test. 

Each scheme's obligations are calculated using the projected unit credit method. Scheme assets are stated at fair value as at the period end.

Changes in pension scheme liabilities or assets (remeasurements) that do not arise from regular pension cost, net interest on net defined 
benefit liabilities or assets, past service costs, settlements or contributions to the scheme, are recognised in other comprehensive income. 
Remeasurements comprise experience adjustments (differences between previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred), 
the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions, return on scheme assets (excluding amounts included in the interest on the assets) and any 
changes in the effect of the asset ceiling restriction (excluding amounts included in the interest on the restriction).

Post-employment benefit schemes – the cost of providing healthcare benefits to retired employees is accrued as a liability in the financial 
statements over the period that the employees provide services to the Group, using a methodology similar to that for defined benefit pension 
schemes.

Pension schemes
UK Retirement Fund (UKRF)
The UKRF is the Barclays Group's main scheme, representing 97% of the Barclays Group's total retirement benefit obligations. Barclays Bank PLC is 
the principal employer of the UKRF. The UKRF was closed to new entrants on 1 October 2012, and comprises 10 sections, the two most significant 
of which are: 

■■ Afterwork, which comprises a contributory cash balance defined benefit element, and a voluntary defined contribution element. The cash 
balance element is accrued each year and revalued until Normal Retirement Age in line with the increase in Retail Price Index (RPI) (up to a 
maximum of 5% p.a.). An increase of up to 2% a year may also be added at Barclays' discretion. The costs of ill-health retirements and death in 
service benefits for Afterwork members are borne by the UKRF. The main risks that Barclays runs in relation to Afterwork are limited although 
additional contributions are required if pre-retirement investment returns are not sufficient to provide for the benefits.

■■ The 1964 Pension Scheme. Most employees recruited before July 1997 built up benefits in this non-contributory defined benefit scheme in 
respect of service up to 31 March 2010. Pensions were calculated by reference to service and pensionable salary. From 1 April 2010, members 
became eligible to accrue future service benefits in either Afterwork or the Pension Investment Plan (PIP), a historic defined contribution 
section which is now closed to future contributions. The risks that Barclays runs in relation to the 1964 section are typical of final salary 
pension schemes, principally that investment returns fall short of expectations, that inflation exceeds expectations, and that retirees live longer 
than expected.

Barclays Pension Savings Plan (BPSP)
The BPSP is a defined contribution scheme providing benefits for all new UK hires from 1 October 2012, BPSP is not subject to the same 
investment return, inflation or life expectancy risks for Barclays that defined benefit schemes are. Members' benefits reflect contributions paid and 
the level of investment returns achieved. 

Other
Apart from the UKRF and the BPSP, Barclays operates a number of smaller pension and long-term employee benefits and post-retirement 
healthcare plans globally, the largest of which are the US defined benefit schemes. Many of the schemes are funded, with assets backing the 
obligations held in separate legal vehicles such as trusts. Others are operated on an unfunded basis. The benefits provided, the approach to 
funding, and the legal basis of the schemes, reflect local environments. 

Governance
The UKRF operates under trust law and is managed and administered on behalf of the members in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed 
and Rules and all relevant legislation. The Corporate Trustee is Barclays Pension Funds Trustees Limited, a private limited company and a 
wholly-owned subsidiary of Barclays Bank PLC. The Trustee is the legal owner of the assets of the UKRF which are held separately from the assets 
of the Barclays Group.

The Trustee Board comprises six Management Directors selected by Barclays, of whom three are independent Directors with no relationship with 
Barclays (and who are not members of the UKRF), plus three Member Nominated Directors selected from eligible active staff, deferred and 
pensioner members who apply for the role.

The BPSP is a Group Personal Pension arrangement which operates as a collection of personal pension plans. Each personal pension plan is a 
direct contract between the employee and the BPSP provider (Legal & General Assurance Society Limited), and is regulated by the FCA.

Similar principles of pension governance apply to the Barclays Group's other pension schemes, depending on local legislation.

Included within the benefit obligation was £759m (2018: £757m) relating to overseas pensions and £202m (2018: £204m) relating to other 
post-employment benefits. 

As at 31 December 2019, the UKRF's scheme assets were in surplus versus IAS 19 obligations by £2,058m (2018: £1,735m). The movement for the 
UKRF was driven by higher than assumed asset returns, payment of deficit reduction contributions, updated mortality assumptions, and lower 
than expected inflation, partially offset by a decrease in the discount rate. 

The weighted average duration of the benefit payments reflected in the defined benefit obligation for the UKRF is 17 years. The UKRF expected 
benefits are projected to be paid out for in excess of 50 years, although 25% of the total benefits are expected to be paid in the next 10 years; 30% 
in years 11 to 20 and 25% in years 20 to 30. The remainder of the benefits are expected to be paid beyond 30 years.

Of the £1,410m (2018: £2,167m) UKRF benefits paid out, £580m (2018: £1,420m) related to transfers out of the fund.

Where a scheme's assets exceed its obligation, an asset is recognised to the extent that it does not exceed the present value of future contribution 
holidays or refunds of contributions (the asset ceiling). In the case of the UKRF the asset ceiling is not applied as, in certain specified 
circumstances such as wind-up, the Group expects to be able to recover any surplus. Similarly, a liability in respect of future minimum funding 
requirements is not recognised. The Trustee does not have a substantive right to augment benefits, nor do they have the right to wind up the plan 
except in the dissolution of the Group or termination of contributions by the Group. The application of the asset ceiling to other plans and 
recognition of additional liabilities in respect of future minimum funding requirements are considered on an individual plan basis.

Discount rate 1.92 2.71
Inflation rate (RPI) 3.02 3.25

The UKRF discount rate assumption for 2019 was based on a variant of the standard Willis Towers Watson RATE Link model. This variant includes 
all bonds rated AA by at least one of the four major ratings agencies, and assumes that forward rates after year 30 are flat. The RPI inflation 
assumption for 2019 was set by reference to the Bank of England's implied inflation curve, assuming the forward rates remain flat after 30 years. 
The inflation assumption incorporates a deduction of 20 basis points as an allowance for an inflation risk premium. The methodology used to 
derive the discount rate and price inflation assumptions is consistent with that used at the prior year end, except for a switch to holding forward 
rates rather spot rates flat after year 30.

The UKRF's post-retirement mortality assumptions are based on a best estimate assumption derived from an analysis in 2019 of the UKRF's own 
post-retirement mortality experience, and taking account of recent evidence from published mortality surveys. An allowance has been made for 
future mortality improvements based on the 2018 core projection model published by the Continuous Mortality Investigation Bureau subject to a 
long-term trend of 1.5% per annum in future improvements. The methodology used is consistent with the prior year end, except that the 2017 
core projection model was used at 2018, and a long-trend of 1.25% per annum was applied. The table below shows how the assumed life 
expectancy at 60, for members of the UKRF, has varied over the past three years:

Assumed life expectancy 2019 2018 2017
Life expectancy at 60 for current pensioners (years)
– Males 27.1 27.7 27.8
– Females 29.3 29.4 29.4
Life expectancy at 60 for future pensioners currently aged 40 (years)
– Males 28.9 29.2 29.3
– Females 31.1 31.0 31.0

The assumption for future transfers out has been removed, to reflect lower volumes experienced in 2019 and immaterial volumes expected going 
forwards. The previous assumption was that 5% of the benefit obligation in respect of deferred members will transfer out during 2020, 2.5% in 
2021, tapering down to 0% from 2022 onwards.

Sensitivity analysis on actuarial assumptions
The sensitivity analysis has been calculated by valuing the UKRF liabilities using the amended assumptions shown in the table below and keeping 
the remaining assumptions the same as disclosed in the table above, except in the case of the inflation sensitivity where other assumptions that 
depend on assumed inflation have also been amended correspondingly. The difference between the recalculated liability figure and that stated in 
the balance sheet reconciliation table above is the figure shown. The selection of these movements to illustrate the sensitivity of the defined 
benefit obligation to key assumptions should not be interpreted as Barclays expressing any specific view of the probability of such movements 
happening.

Assets
A long-term investment strategy has been set for the UKRF, with its asset allocation comprising a mixture of equities, bonds, property and other 
appropriate assets. This recognises that different asset classes are likely to produce different long-term returns and some asset classes may be 
more volatile than others. The long-term investment strategy ensures, among other aims, that investments are adequately diversified.

The UKRF also employs derivative instruments, where appropriate, to achieve a desired exposure or return, or to match assets more closely to 
liabilities. The value of assets shown reflects the assets held by the scheme, with any derivative holdings reflected on a fair value basis. 

The value of the assets of the schemes and their percentage in relation to total scheme assets were as follows:

Included within the fair value of scheme assets were nil (2018: nil) relating to shares in Barclays PLC and nil (2018: nil) relating to bonds issued by 
Barclays PLC. The UKRF also invests in pooled investment vehicles which may hold shares or debt issued by Barclays PLC.

The UKRF assets above do not include the Senior Notes asset referred to in the section below on Triennial Valuation, as these are non-transferable 
instruments and not recognised under IAS19.

Approximately 44% of the UKRF assets are invested in liability-driven investment strategies; primarily UK gilts as well as interest rate and inflation 
swaps. These are used to better match the assets to its liabilities. The swaps are used to reduce the scheme's inflation and duration risks against 
its liabilities.

Triennial valuation
The latest triennial actuarial valuation of the UKRF with an effective date of 30 September 2019 has been completed. This valuation showed a 
funding deficit of £2.3bn and a funding level of 94%, compared to a £4.0bn funding deficit in the 30 September 2018 update, and a £7.9bn 
funding deficit in the previous triennial valuation (effective date 30 September 2016). The decrease in funding deficit over the year to 
30 September 2019 was mainly driven by the payment of deficit reduction contributions and changes to mortality assumptions.

The Bank and UKRF Trustee have agreed a revised statement of funding principles, schedule of contributions, and recovery plan to seek to 
eliminate the funding deficit.

The main differences between the funding and accounting assumptions are a different approach to setting the discount rate and a more 
conservative longevity assumption for funding.

The deficit reduction contributions agreed with the UKRF Trustee as part of the 30 September 2019 triennial valuation recovery plan are shown 
alongside the deficit reduction contributions agreed in 2017 for the prior 30 September 2016 triennial valuation.

As part of the triennial actuarial valuation, Barclays Bank PLC agreed to pay a £500m contribution on 11 December 2019 and at the same time the 
UKRF subscribed for non-transferable listed senior fixed rate notes for £500m, backed by UK gilts (the Senior Notes). The Senior Notes were issued 
by Heron Issuer Limited (Heron), an entity that is consolidated within the Barclays Group under IFRS 10. The Senior Notes entitle the UKRF to 
semi-annual coupon payments for five years, and full repayment of the subscription in cash at maturity in 2024. Heron acquired the gilts from 
BBPLC for cash of £600m to support these payments. BBPLC also subscribed for Junior notes issued by Heron for £100m. The contribution forms 
part of the recovery plan agreed as part of the 2019 valuation of the UKRF. No liability is recognised under IAS19 for the obligation to make deficit 
reduction contributions or to repay the Senior Notes, as settlement in 2024 gives rise to both a reduction in cash and a corresponding increase in 
net defined benefit assets.

The deficit reduction contributions are in addition to the regular contributions to meet the Barclays Group's share of the cost of benefits accruing 
over each year. The next funding valuation of the UKRF is due to be completed in 2023 with an effective date of 30 September 2022.

Other support measures agreed which remain in place
Collateral – The UKRF Trustee and Barclays Bank PLC have entered into an arrangement whereby a collateral pool has been put in place to provide 
security for the UKRF funding deficit as it increases or decreases over time. The collateral pool is currently made up of government securities, and 
agreement was made with the Trustee to cover 100% of the funding deficit with an overall cap of £9bn. The arrangement provides the UKRF 
Trustee with dedicated access to the pool of assets in the event of Barclays Bank PLC not paying a deficit reduction contribution to the UKRF or in 
the event of Barclays Bank PLC's insolvency. These assets are included within Note 38 Assets pledged, collateral received and assets transferred.

Support from Barclays PLC – In the event of Barclays Bank PLC not paying a deficit reduction contribution payment required by a specified 
pre-payment date, Barclays PLC has entered into an arrangement whereby it will be required to use, in first priority, dividends received from 
Barclays Bank UK PLC (if any) to invest the proceeds in Barclays Bank PLC (up to the maximum amount of the deficit reduction contribution 
unpaid by Barclays Bank PLC). The proceeds of the investment will be used to discharge Barclays Bank PLC's unpaid deficit reduction contribution.

Participation – As permitted under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Banking Reform) (Pensions) Regulations 2015, Barclays Bank UK 
PLC is a participating employer in the UKRF and will remain so during a transitional phase until September 2025 as set out in a deed of 
participation. Barclays Bank UK PLC will make contributions for the future service of its employees who are currently Afterwork members and, in 
the event of Barclays Bank PLC's insolvency during this period provision has been made to require Barclays Bank UK PLC to become the principal 
employer of the UKRF. Barclays Bank PLC's Section 75 debt would be triggered by the insolvency (the debt would be calculated after allowing for 
the payment to the UKRF of the collateral above).

Defined benefit contributions paid with respect to the UKRF were as follows:

Contributions paid
£m

2019 1,231
2018 741
2017 1,124

There were nil (2018: nil; 2017: £153m) Section 75 contributions included within the Barclays Group's contributions paid as no participating 
employers left the UKRF scheme in 2019.

The Barclays Group's expected contribution to the UKRF in respect of defined benefits in 2020 is £743m (2019: £725m). In addition, the expected 
contributions to UK defined contribution schemes in 2020 is £33m (2019: £34m) to the UKRF and £185m (2019: £168m) to the BPSP.

Scope of consolidation

The notes included in this section present information on the Group's investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates and its 
interests in structured entities. Detail is also given on securitisation transactions the Group has entered into and arrangements that are held 
off-balance sheet.

34 Principal subsidiaries

The Group applies IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements. The consolidated financial statements combine the financial statements of the 
Group and all its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has control. Under IFRS 10, this is when the Group is exposed or 
has rights to variable returns from its involvement in the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.

The Group reassesses whether it controls an entity if facts and circumstances indicate that there have been changes to its power, its rights to 
variable returns or its ability to use its power to affect the amount of its returns.

Intra-group transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation and consistent accounting policies are used throughout the Group for 
the purposes of the consolidation. Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions if they occur after 
control has been obtained and they do not result in loss of control.

The significant judgements used in applying this policy are set out below.

Accounting for investment in subsidiaries
In the individual financial statements of Barclays PLC, investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less impairment.

Principal subsidiaries for the Group are set out below. This includes those subsidiaries that are most significant in the context of the Group's 
business, results or financial position.

The country of registration or incorporation is also the principal area of operation of each of the above subsidiaries. 

Ownership interests are in some cases different to voting interests due to the existence of non-voting equity interests, such as preference shares. 
Refer to Note 30 for more information. 

Determining whether the Group has control of an entity is generally straightforward based on ownership of the majority of the voting capital. 
However, in certain instances, this determination will involve judgement, particularly in the case of structured entities where voting rights are often 
not the determining factor in decisions over the relevant activities. This judgement will involve assessing the purpose and design of the entity. It 
will also often be necessary to consider whether the Group, or another involved party with power over the relevant activities, is acting as a 
principal in its own right or as an agent on behalf of others.  

There is also often considerable judgement involved in the ongoing assessment of control over structured entities. In this regard, where market 
conditions have deteriorated such that the other investors' exposures to the structure's variable returns have been substantively eliminated, the 
Group may conclude that the managers of the structured entity are acting as its agent and therefore will consolidate the structured entity. 

An interest in equity voting rights exceeding 50% would typically indicate that the Group has control of an entity. However, the entity set out 
below is excluded from consolidation because the Group does not have exposure to its variable returns.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

34 Principal subsidiaries continued
Significant restrictions
As is typical for a group of its size and international scope, there are restrictions on the ability of Barclays PLC to obtain distributions of capital, 
access the assets or repay the liabilities of members of its Group due to the statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements of its subsidiaries 
and due to the protective rights of non-controlling interests. These are considered below.

Regulatory requirements
Barclays' principal subsidiary companies have assets and liabilities before intercompany eliminations of £1,474bn (2018: £1,418bn) and £1,388bn 
(2018: £1,337bn) respectively. The assets and liabilities are subject to prudential regulation and regulatory capital requirements in the countries in 
which they are regulated. These require entities to maintain minimum capital levels which cannot be returned to the parent company, Barclays PLC 
on a going concern basis. 

In order to meet capital requirements, subsidiaries may issue certain equity-accounted and debt-accounted financial instruments and non-equity 
instruments such as Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital instruments and other forms of subordinated liabilities. Refer to Note 27 and Note 28 for particulars 
of these instruments. These instruments may be subject to cancellation clauses or preference share restrictions that would limit the ability of the 
entity to repatriate the capital on a timely basis.

Liquidity requirements
Regulated subsidiaries of the Group are required to meet applicable PRA or local regulatory requirements pertaining to liquidity. Some of the 
regulated subsidiaries include Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Capital Securities Limited (which are regulated on a combined basis under a 
Domestic Liquidity Sub-Group (DoLSub) arrangement), Barclays Bank UK PLC, Barclays Bank Ireland PLC, Barclays Capital Inc. and Barclays Bank 
Delaware. See pages 180 to 189 for further details of liquidity requirements, including those of the Group's significant subsidiaries.

Statutory requirements 
The Group's subsidiaries are subject to statutory requirements not to make distributions of capital and unrealised profits and generally to maintain 
solvency. These requirements restrict the ability of subsidiaries to make remittances of dividends to Barclays PLC, the ultimate parent, except in the 
event of a legal capital reduction or liquidation. In most cases, the regulatory restrictions referred to above exceed the statutory restrictions.

Contractual requirements
Asset encumbrance
The Group uses its financial assets to raise finance in the form of securitisations and through the liquidity schemes of central banks, as well as to 
provide security to the UK Retirement Fund. Once encumbered, the assets are not available for transfer around the Group. The assets typically 
affected are disclosed in Note 38.

Other restrictions
The Group is required to maintain balances with central banks and other regulatory authorities, and these amounted to £4,893m (2018: £4,717m).

35 Structured entities
A structured entity is an entity in which voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding control. Structured entities are generally 
created to achieve a narrow and well-defined objective with restrictions around their ongoing activities. 

Depending on the Group's power over the activities of the entity and its exposure to and ability to influence its own returns, it may consolidate the 
entity. In other cases, it may sponsor or have exposure to such an entity but not consolidate it.

Consolidated structured entities
The Group has contractual arrangements which may require it to provide financial support to the following types of consolidated structured 
entities:

Securitisation vehicles
The Group uses securitisation as a source of financing and a means of risk transfer. Refer to Note 37 for further detail.

Commercial paper (CP) and medium-term note conduits
The Group provided £8.3bn (2018: £11.7bn) in undrawn contractual backstop liquidity facilities to CP conduits.

Fund management entities
In previous periods, the Group had contractually guaranteed the performance of certain cash investments in a number of managed investment 
funds which resulted in their consolidation. As at 31 December 2019, the notional value of the guarantees were nil (2018: nil) as the European 
Wealth Funds associated with these guarantees were either closed or ownership has been transferred outside the Group and they are no longer 
consolidated.

Employee benefit and other trusts
The Group provides capital contributions to employee benefit trusts to enable them to meet obligations to employees in relation to share-based 
remuneration arrangements. During 2019, the Group provided undrawn liquidity facilities of £2.5bn (2018: £2.6bn) to certain trusts.

35 Structured entities continued

Unconsolidated structured entities in which the Group has an interest
An interest in a structured entity is any form of contractual or non-contractual involvement which creates variability in returns arising from the 
performance of the entity for the Group. Such interests include holdings of debt or equity securities, derivatives that transfer financial risks from 
the entity to the Group, lending, loan commitments, financial guarantees and investment management agreements.

Interest rate swaps, foreign exchange derivatives that are not complex and which expose the Group to insignificant credit risk by being senior in 
the payment waterfall of a securitisation and derivatives that are determined to introduce risk or variability to a structured entity are not 
considered to be an interest in an entity and have been excluded from the disclosures below.

The nature and extent of the Group's interests in structured entities is summarised below:

Secured financing arrangements, short-term traded interests and traded derivatives are typically managed under market risk management policies 
described on page 141 which includes an indication of the change of risk measures compared to last year. For this reason, the total assets of these 
entities are not considered meaningful for the purposes of understanding the related risks and so have not been presented. Other interests include 
conduits and lending where the interest is driven by normal customer demand.

Secured financing 
The Group routinely enters into reverse repurchase contracts, stock borrowing and similar arrangements on normal commercial terms where the 
counterparty to the arrangement is a structured entity. Due to the nature of these arrangements, especially the transfer of collateral and ongoing 
margining, the Group has minimal exposure to the performance of the structured entity counterparty. This includes margin lending which is 
presented under financial assets at fair value through the income statement to align to the balance sheet presentation. 

Short-term traded interests
The Group buys and sells interests in structured entities as part of its trading activities, for example, retail mortgage-backed securities, 
collateralised debt obligations and similar interests. Such interests are typically held individually or as part of a larger portfolio for no more than 90 
days. In such cases, the Group typically has no other involvement with the structured entity other than the securities it holds as part of trading 
activities and its maximum exposure to loss is restricted to the carrying value of the asset.

As at 31 December 2019, £8,903m (2018: £8,436m) of the Group's £9,585m (2018: £12,206m) short-term traded interests were comprised of 
debt securities issued by asset securitisation vehicles.

Traded derivatives
The Group enters into a variety of derivative contracts with structured entities which reference market risk variables such as interest rates, foreign 
exchange rates and credit indices among other things. The main derivative types which are considered interests in structured entities include 
index-based and entity specific credit default swaps, balance guaranteed swaps, total return swaps, commodities swaps, and equity swaps. A 
description of the types of derivatives and the risk management practices are detailed in Note 14. The risk of loss may be mitigated through 
ongoing margining requirements as well as a right to cash flows from the structured entity which are senior in the payment waterfall. Such 
margining requirements are consistent with market practice for many derivative arrangements and in line with the Group's normal credit policies.

Scope of consolidation
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

35 Structured entities continued
Derivative transactions require the counterparty to provide cash or other collateral under margining agreements to mitigate counterparty credit 
risk. The Group is mainly exposed to settlement risk on these derivatives which is mitigated through daily margining. Total notionals amounted to 
£314,170m (2018: £246,774m).

Except for credit default swaps where the maximum exposure to loss is the swap notional amount, it is not possible to estimate the maximum 
exposure to loss in respect of derivative positions as the fair value of derivatives is subject to changes in market rates of interest, exchange rates 
and credit indices which by their nature are uncertain. In addition, the Group's losses would be subject to mitigating action under its traded market 
risk and credit risk policies that require the counterparty to provide collateral in cash or other assets in most cases.

Other interests in unconsolidated structured entities
The Group's interests in structured entities not held for the purposes of short-term trading activities are set out below, summarised by the purpose

Total assets of the entity 73,109 196,865 9,341 28,163 307,478

Maximum exposure to loss
Unless specified otherwise below, the Group's maximum exposure to loss is the total of its on-balance sheet positions and its off-balance sheet 
arrangements, being loan commitments and financial guarantees. Exposure to loss is mitigated through collateral, financial guarantees, the 
availability of netting and credit protection held.

Multi-seller conduit programme
The multi-seller conduit engages in providing financing to various clients and holds whole or partial interests in pools of receivables or similar 
obligations. These instruments are protected from loss through overcollateralisation, seller guarantees, or other credit enhancements provided to 
the conduit. The Group's off-balance sheet exposure included in the table above represents liquidity facilities that are provided to the conduit for 
the benefit of the holders of the commercial paper issued by the conduit and will only be drawn where the conduit is unable to access the 
commercial paper market. If these liquidity facilities are drawn, the Group is protected from loss through overcollateralisation, seller guarantees, or 
other credit enhancements provided to the conduit.

Lending
The portfolio includes lending provided by the Group to unconsolidated structured entities in the normal course of its lending business to earn 
income in the form of interest and lending fees and includes loans to structured entities that are generally collateralised by property, equipment or 
other assets. All loans are subject to the Group's credit sanctioning process. Collateral arrangements are specific to the circumstances of each loan 
with additional guarantees and collateral sought from the sponsor of the structured entity for certain arrangements. During the period the Group 
incurred an impairment of £7m (2018: £67m) against such facilities.

35 Structured entities continued
Investment funds and trusts 
In the course of its fund management activities, the Group establishes pooled investment funds that comprise investments of various kinds, 
tailored to meet certain investors' requirements. The Group's interest in funds is generally restricted to a fund management fee, the value of which 
is typically based on the performance of the fund.

The Group acts as trustee to a number of trusts established by or on behalf of its clients. The purpose of the trusts, which meet the definition of 
structured entities, is to hold assets on behalf of beneficiaries. The Group's interest in trusts is generally restricted to unpaid fees which, depending 
on the trust, may be fixed or based on the value of the trust assets. The Group has no other risk exposure to the trusts.

Other
This includes fair value loans with structured entities where the market risk is materially hedged with corresponding derivative contracts, interests 
in debt securities issued by securitisation vehicles and drawn and undrawn loan facilities to these entities.

Assets transferred to sponsored unconsolidated structured entities
Assets transferred to sponsored unconsolidated structured entities were £471m (2018: £516m).

36 Investments in associates and joint ventures

Accounting for associates and joint ventures
The Group applies IAS 28 Investments in Associates and IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements. Associates are entities in which the Group has significant 
influence, but not control, over the operating and financial policies. Generally the Group holds more than 20%, but less than 50%, of their 
voting shares. Joint ventures are arrangements where the Group has joint control and rights to the net assets of the entity. 

The Group's investments in associates and joint ventures are initially recorded at cost and increased (or decreased) each year by the Group's 
share of the post acquisition profit/(loss). The Group ceases to recognise its share of the losses of equity accounted associates when its share 
of the net assets and amounts due from the entity have been written off in full, unless it has a contractual or constructive obligation to make 
good its share of the losses. In some cases, investments in these entities may be held at fair value through profit or loss, for example, those 
held by private equity businesses.

There are no individually significant investments in joint ventures or associates held by the Group.

£1,726m (2018: £1,715m). In addition, the Group has made commitments to finance or otherwise provide resources to its joint ventures and 
associates of £403m (2018: £318m).

Scope of consolidation
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

37 Securitisations

Accounting for securitisations
The Group uses securitisations as a source of finance and a means of risk transfer. Such transactions generally result in the transfer of 
contractual cash flows from portfolios of financial assets to holders of issued debt securities.

Securitisations may, depending on the individual arrangement, result in continued recognition of the securitised assets and the recognition of 
the debt securities issued in the transaction; lead to partial continued recognition of the assets to the extent of the Group's continuing 
involvement in those assets or to derecognition of the assets and the separate recognition, as assets or liabilities, of any rights and obligations 
created or retained in the transfer. Full derecognition only occurs when the Group transfers both its contractual right to receive cash flows from 
the financial assets, or retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows, but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to 
another party without material delay or reinvestment, and also transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, including credit 
risk, prepayment risk and interest rate risk.

In the course of its normal banking activities, the Group makes transfers of financial assets, either where legal rights to the cash flows from the 
asset are passed to the counterparty or beneficially, where the Group retains the rights to the cash flows but assumes a responsibility to transfer 
them to the counterparty. Depending on the nature of the transaction, this may result in derecognition of the assets in their entirety, partial 
derecognition or no derecognition of the assets subject to the transfer. 

A summary of the main transactions, and the assets and liabilities and the financial risks arising from these transactions, is set out below:

Transfers of financial assets that do not result in derecognition
Securitisations
The Group was party to securitisation transactions involving its credit card balances. 

In these transactions, the assets, interests in the assets, or beneficial interests in the cash flows arising from the assets, are transferred to a special 
purpose entity, which then issues interest bearing debt securities to third party investors. 

Securitisations may, depending on the individual arrangement, result in continued recognition of the securitised assets and the recognition of the 
debt securities issued in the transaction. Partial continued recognition of the assets to the extent of the Group's continuing involvement in those 
assets can also occur or derecognition of the assets and the separate recognition, as assets or liabilities, of any rights and obligations created or 
retained in the transfer. 

The following table shows the carrying amount of securitised assets that have not resulted in full derecognition, together with the associated 
liabilities, for each category of asset on the balance sheet:

other retail lending 3,516 3,678 (2,918) (2,922) 4,242 4,334 (4,234) (4,218)

Balances included within loans and advances at amortised cost represent securitisations where substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset 
have been retained by the Group.

The relationship between the transferred assets and the associated liabilities is that holders of notes may only look to cash flows from the 
securitised assets for payments of principal and interest due to them under the terms of their notes, although the contractual terms of their notes 
may be different to the maturity and interest of the transferred assets.

For transfers of assets in relation to repurchase agreements, refer to Note 38.

37 Securitisations continued

Continuing involvement in financial assets that have been derecognised
In some cases, the Group may have transferred a financial asset in its entirety but may have continuing involvement in it. This arises in asset 
securitisations where loans and asset backed securities were derecognised as a result of the Group's involvement with commercial mortgage 
backed securities. Continuing involvement largely arises from providing financing into these structures in the form of retained notes, which do not 
bear first losses.

The table below shows the potential financial implications of such continuing involvement:

Note
a  Assets which represent the Group's continuing involvement in derecognised assets are recorded in Loans and advances at amortised cost.

38 Assets pledged, collateral received and assets transferred
Assets are pledged or transferred as collateral to secure liabilities under repurchase agreements, securitisations and stock lending agreements or 
as security deposits relating to derivatives. Assets transferred are non-cash assets transferred to a third party that do not qualify for derecognition 
from the Group balance sheet, for example because Barclays retains substantially all the exposure to those assets under an agreement to 
repurchase them in the future for a fixed price.

Assets pledged or transferred as collateral include all assets categorised as encumbered in the disclosure on pages 221 to 222 of the Barclays PLC 
Pillar 3 Report 2019 (unaudited), other than those held in commercial paper conduits. In these transactions, the Group will be required to step in 
to provide financing itself under a liquidity facility if the vehicle cannot access the commercial paper market.

Where non-cash assets are pledged or transferred as collateral for cash received, the asset continues to be recognised in full, and a related liability 
is also recognised on the balance sheet. Liabilities are shown on a net basis in accordance with IAS 32. Where non-cash assets are pledged or 
transferred as collateral in an exchange for non-cash assets, the transferred asset continues to be recognised in full, and there is no associated 
liability as the non-cash collateral received is not recognised on the balance sheet. The Group is unable to use, sell or pledge the transferred assets 
for the duration of the transaction and remains exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk on these pledged assets. Unless stated, the 
counterparty's recourse is not limited to the transferred assets.

The following table summarises the nature and carrying amount of the assets pledged as security against these liabilities:

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

41 Discontinued operations and assets included in disposal groups classified as held 
for sale and associated liabilities

Accounting for non-current assets held for sale and associated liabilities
The Group applies IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations.

Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale 
transaction rather than continuing use. In order to be classified as held for sale, the asset must be available for immediate sale in its present 
condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary and the sale must be highly probable. Non-current assets (or disposal groups) 
held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell.

A component of the Group that has either been disposed of or is classified as held for sale is presented as a discontinued operation if it 
represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of the separate 
major line or geographical area of operations, or if it is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.

Discontinued operation
Following the reduction of the Group's interest in BAGL in 2017, the Group's remaining holding of 14.9%, as at 31 December 2019, is reported as a 
financial asset at fair value through other comprehensive income in the Head Office segment, with the Group's share of Absa Group Limited's 
dividend recognised in the Head Office income statement.

Prior to the disposal of shares on 1 June 2017, BAGL met the requirements for presentation as a discontinued operation. As such, the results, which 
have been presented as the profit after tax and non-controlling interest in respect of the discontinued operation on the face of the Group's income 
statement, are analysed in the income statement below. The income statement, statement of other comprehensive income and cash flow 
statement below represent five months of results as a discontinued operation to 31 May 2017.

42 Barclays PLC (the Parent company)

Total income
Dividends received from subsidiaries
Dividends received from subsidiaries of £1,560m (2018: £15,360m, 2017: £674m) largely relates to dividends received from Barclays Bank UK PLC 
£1,050m, Barclays Execution Services Limited £250m and Barclays Bank PLC £233m. The dividends received in 2018 included both a dividend in 
specie, representing the transfer of the holding in Barclays Bank UK PLC from Barclays Bank PLC to Barclays PLC, and ordinary dividends from 
subsidiaries.

Other income
Other income of £1,760m (2018: £923m, 2017: £690m) includes £813m (2018: £752m, 2017: £639m) of income received from gross coupon 
payments on Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Bank UK PLC issued AT1 securities and £947m of fair value and foreign exchange gains on other 
positions with subsidiaries. This includes a fair value net loss of £81m for own credit movements on financial liabilities designated at fair value.

Total assets and liabilities
Investment in subsidiaries
The investment in subsidiaries of £59,546m (2018: £57,374m) predominantly relates to investments in Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Bank UK 
PLC, as well as holdings of their AT1 securities of £10,843m (2018: £9,666m). The increase of £2,172m during the year was predominantly driven 
by capital contributions into Barclays Bank PLC totalling £995m and additional AT1 holdings of $2,000m, £1,000m and £1,000m, partially offset by 
the redemption of AT1 holdings with principal amounts totalling $1,211m, €1,077m and £698m.

At the end of each reporting period an impairment review is undertaken in respect of investment in subsidiaries. Impairment is required where the 
investment exceeds the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is calculated using a value in use (VIU) methodology to arrive at the present 
value of future cash flows expected to be derived from the investment. The VIU calculation uses forecast attributable profit, based on financial 
budgets approved by management, covering a five-year period, as an approximation of future cash flows. A terminal growth rate of 1.5% has been 
applied to arrive at cash flows thereafter, which is based on long-term expected growth rates published by the International Monetary Fund. The 
forecasted cash flows have been discounted at a pre-tax rate of 13.7%. The calculation showed a VIU higher than the carrying value of 
investments in ordinary shares and no impairment was recognised as a result of the impairment review.

Financial assets and liabilities designated at fair value
Financial liabilities designated at fair value of £3,498m (2018: nil) comprises $2,750m Fixed-to-Floating Rate Senior Notes, £600m Fixed Rate 
Senior Notes, AUD940m Fixed and Floating Rate Senior Notes and ¥20,000m Fixed-to-Floating Rate Bonds. The proceeds raised through these 
transactions were used to invest in subsidiaries of Barclays PLC and are included within the financial assets designated at fair value through the 
income statement balance of £10,348m (2018: £6,945m). The effect of changes in the liabilities' fair value, including those due to credit risk, is 
expected to offset the changes in the fair value of the related financial asset in the income statement. The cumulative own credit net loss on 
financial liabilities designated at fair value is £81m (2018: nil). The difference between the financial liabilities' carrying amount and the contractual 
amount on maturity is £174m (2018: nil).

Subordinated liabilities and Debt Securities in issue
During the year, Barclays PLC issued $1,500m of Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes, which are included within the subordinated liabilities 
balance of £7,656m (2018: £6,775m). Debt Securities in issue of £30,564m (2018: £32,373m) have reduced in the year due to the maturity of 
positions with subsidiaries partially offset by an issuance of a new Senior Fixed Rate Note of €750m.

Management of internal investments, loans and advances
Barclays PLC retains the discretion to manage the nature of its internal investments in subsidiaries according to their regulatory and business 
needs. Barclays PLC may invest capital and funding into Barclays Bank PLC, Barclays Bank UK PLC and other Group subsidiaries such as the 
Barclays Execution Services Limited and the US Intermediate Holding Company (IHC).

Total equity
Called up share capital and share premium
Called up share capital and share premium of Barclays PLC is £4,594m (2018: £4,311m). The increase in the year is primarily due to shares issued 
under employee share schemes and the Scrip Dividend Programme.

Other equity instruments
Other equity instruments of £10,865m (2018: £9,633m) comprises AT1 securities issued by Barclays PLC. AT1 securities are perpetual 
subordinated contingent convertible securities structured to qualify as AT1 instruments under prevailing capital rules applicable as at the relevant 
issue date. There have been three issuances during the year with principal amounts totalling $2,000m, £1,000m and £1,000m, and redemptions 
with principal amounts $1,211m, €1,077m and £698m. For further details, please refer to Note 28.

The Barclays PLC 2019 full year dividend for

dividend 9.0p.

The Company understands the importance 
of delivering attractive cash returns to

committed to maintaining an appropriate 
balance between total cash returns to 
shareholders, investment in the business, 
and maintaining a strong capital position. 

Going forward, the Company intends to pay 
a progressive dividend taking into account 
these objectives, and the earnings outlook of 
the Group. It is also the Board's intention to 
supplement the ordinary dividends with 
additional returns to shareholders as and 
when appropriate.

The Board notes that in determining any 
proposed distributions to shareholders, 
the Board will consider the expectation 
of servicing more senior securities.

Returning funds to shareholders
Over 60,000 shareholders did not cash their 
Shares Not Taken Up (SNTU) cheque following 
the Rights Issue in September 2013. In 2019, 
we continued the tracing process to reunite 
these shareholders with their SNTU monies 
and any unclaimed dividends and by the end 
of the year, we had returned approximately 
£23,288 to our shareholders, in addition to 
the approximately £65,000 returned in 2018, 
£212,000 returned in 2017, £1.65m returned 
in 2016 and £2.2m in 2015.

Donations to charity
We launched a Share Dealing Service in 
October 2017 aimed at shareholders with 
relatively small shareholdings for whom it 
might otherwise be uneconomical to deal. 
One option open to shareholders was to 
donate their sale proceeds to ShareGift.  
As a result of this initiative, £58,267 was 
donated in 2019, taking the total donated 
since 2015 to over £403,000.

Shareholder security
Shareholders should be wary of any cold 
calls with an offer to buy or sell shares. 
Fraudsters use persuasive and high-
pressure techniques to lure shareholders 
into high-risk investments or scams. 
You should treat any unsolicited calls 
with caution.

Please keep in mind that firms authorised 
by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) 
are unlikely to contact you out of the blue. 
You should consider getting independent 
financial or professional advice from 
someone unconnected to the respective 
firm before you hand over any money.

Report a scam
If you suspect that you have been 
approached by fraudsters please tell the 
FCA using the share fraud reporting form 
at fca.org.uk/scams. You can also call 
the FCA Helpline on 0800 111 6768 or 
through Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040.

The Barclays PLC Strategic Report 2019 was approved by 
the Board of Directors on 12 February 2020 and signed 
on its behalf by the Chairman.

Report of the Auditor 
The Auditor's report on the financial statements of 
Barclays PLC for the year ended 31 December 2019 
was unqualified, and their statement under section 496 
of the Companies Act 2006 was also unqualified 
(see page 232). 

Notes
The terms Barclays or Group refer to Barclays PLC 
together with its subsidiaries. Unless otherwise stated, 
the income statement analysis compares the year ended 
31 December 2019 to the corresponding twelve months 
of 2018 and balance sheet analysis as at 31 December 
2019 with comparatives relating to 31 December 2018. 
The abbreviations ‘£m' and ‘£bn' represent millions and 
thousands of millions of Pounds Sterling respectively; 
the abbreviations ‘$m' and ‘$bn' represent millions and 
thousands of millions of US Dollars respectively; and 
the abbreviations ‘€m' and ‘€bn' represent millions and 
thousands of millions of Euros respectively.

There are a number of key judgement areas, for example 
impairment calculations, which are based on models 
and which are subject to ongoing adjustment and 
modifications. Reported numbers reflect best estimates 
and judgements at the given point in time.

Relevant terms that are used in this document but are 
not defined under applicable regulatory guidance or 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are 
explained in the results glossary that can be accessed at 
home.barclays/investor-relations/reports-and-events/
latest-financial-results.

The information in this announcement, which was 
approved by the Board of Directors on 12 February 2020, 
does not comprise statutory accounts within the 
meaning of Section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Statutory accounts for the year ended 31 December 
2019, which contain an unmodified audit report under 
Section 495 of the Companies Act 2006 (which does not 
make any statements under Section 498 of the 
Companies Act 2006) will be delivered to the Registrar 
of Companies in accordance with Section 441 of the 
Companies Act 2006.

These results will be furnished as a Form 20-F to the US 
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as soon as 
practicable following their publication. Once furnished 
with the SEC, a copy of the Form 20-F will be available 
from the Barclays Investor Relations website at home.
barclays/annualreport and from the SEC's website at 
www.sec.gov.

Barclays is a frequent issuer in the debt capital markets 
and regularly meets with investors via formal roadshows 
and other ad hoc meetings. Consistent with its usual 
practice, Barclays expects that from time to time over 
the coming quarter it will meet with investors globally 
to discuss these results and other matters relating to 
the Group.

Forward-looking statements
This document contains certain forward-looking 
statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the 
US Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, 
and Section 27A of the US Securities Act of 1933, as 
amended, with respect to the Group. Barclays cautions 
readers that no forward-looking statement is a guarantee 
of future performance and that actual results or other 
financial condition or performance measures could differ 
materially from those contained in the forward-looking 
statements. These forward-looking statements can be 
identified by the fact that they do not relate only to 
historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements 
sometimes use words such as ‘may', ‘will', ‘seek', 
‘continue', ‘aim', ‘anticipate', ‘target', ‘projected', ‘expect', 
‘estimate', ‘intend', ‘plan', ‘goal', ‘believe', ‘achieve' or 
other words of similar meaning. Forward-looking 
statements can be made in writing but also may be made 
verbally by members of the management of the Group 
(including, without limitation, during management 
presentations to financial analysts) in connection with 
this document. Examples of forward-looking statements 
include, among others, statements or guidance 
regarding or relating to the Group's future financial 
position, income growth, assets, impairment charges, 
provisions, business strategy, capital, leverage and other 
regulatory ratios, payment of dividends (including 
dividend payout ratios and expected payment strategies), 
projected levels of growth in the banking and financial 
markets, projected costs or savings, any commitments 
and targets, estimates of capital expenditures, plans 
and objectives for future operations, projected employee 
numbers, IFRS impacts and other statements that are 
not historical fact. By their nature, forward-looking 
statements involve risk and uncertainty because they 
relate to future events and circumstances. The 
forward-looking statements speak only as at the date 
on which they are made and such statements may be 
affected by changes in legislation, the development of 
standards and interpretations under IFRS, including 
evolving practices with regard to the interpretation 
and application of accounting and regulatory standards, 
the outcome of current and future legal proceedings 
and regulatory investigations, future levels of conduct 
provisions, the policies and actions of governmental and 
regulatory authorities, geopolitical risks and the impact 
of competition. In addition, factors including (but not 
limited to) the following may have an effect: capital, 
leverage and other regulatory rules applicable to past, 
current and future periods; UK, US, Eurozone and global 
macroeconomic and business conditions; the effects of 
any volatility in credit markets; market related risks such 
as changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates; 

effects of changes in valuation of credit market 
exposures; changes in valuation of issued securities; 
volatility in capital markets; changes in credit ratings of 
any entity within the Group or any securities issued by 
such entities; the potential for one or more countries 
exiting the Eurozone; instability as a result of the exit by 
the UK from the European Union and the disruption that 
may subsequently result in the UK and globally; and the 
success of future acquisitions, disposals and other 
strategic transactions. A number of these influences and 
factors are beyond the Group's control. As a result, the 
Group's actual financial position, future results, dividend 
payments, capital, leverage or other regulatory ratios or 
other financial and non-financial metrics or performance 
measures may differ materially from the statements 
or guidance set forth in the Group's forward-looking 
statements. Additional risks and factors which may 
impact the Group's future financial condition and 
performance are identified in our filings with the SEC 
(including, without limitation, our Annual Report on 
Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended 31 December 2019), 
which are available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.

Subject to our obligations under the applicable laws 
and regulations of any relevant jurisdiction, (including, 
without limitation, the UK and the US), in relation to 
disclosure and ongoing information, we undertake 
no obligation to update publicly or revise any 
forward-looking statements, whether as a result 
of new information, future events or otherwise.
