As aresult, from 15 February\n2019, Highlands Holdings, Limited is the new ultimate parent company of Aspen Insurance UK Limited (\u201cthe Company\u201d\nor \u201cATUK\u201d).\n\nThis was a transitional year for the Company. Following the Merger we undertook a number of actions to strengthen the\nfundamentals of the company and better position the business to create value over the tong term.\n\nUnderwriting Portfolio Review\n\nWe undertook a strategic review of our underwriting portfolio and decided to wind down business that did not meet our\nunderwriting performance criteria. We also took strategic steps to reduce volatility in the underwriting portfolio by reducing\ncatastrophe exposure. .\n\nIn 2019 we ceased underwriting U.K. regional business through an agency agreement with Aspen Risk Management Limited\n\u00a2\u00ab \u201cARML\u00ae ), a managing general agency. The ARML business consisted of professional liability and property and casualty\ncoverages for smail to medium sized U.K.-based businesses. The ARML business was placed into runoff in August 2019.\nAIUK has assumed ARML's underwriting administration and claims handling obligations for the run-off business. In\nNovember 2019 Arch Reinsurance and the Company jointly announced that Arch Re has. entered into a renewal rights\nagreement with the Company on its global credit and surety reinsurance business after our decision to exit the line.\n\nIn 2020 we have placed both marine and energy liability and accident and health lines of business into runoff in February\n2020 and March 2020, respectively.\n\nOperationai Streamiining\n\nWe also undertook initiatives to align our office locations more closely with our customers. and to streamline the structure.\nofour operations. While we closed branches and/or offices in Dubai, Miami and Dublin, we were able to transfer the business\ngenerated by those offices to other locations.\n\nAspen Bermuda established a branch in Zurich, Switzerland in 2019 to write property and casualty reinsurance with inception\ndates of January 1, 2020 and later. This business has previously been written in AIUK. Gross written premium for 2019 was\n$94.7m.\n\nRepositioning Reinsurance Coverage\nWe repositioned certain of our external reinsurance coverage arrangements from quota share reinsurance to targeted excess\nof loss agreements.\n\nIn March 2020, the Group, with ATUK as a named party, entered into an adverse development reinsurance agreement with\na wholly-owned subsidiary of Enstar Group Limited (\u201cEnstar\u201d). Under this agreement the Group will reinsure losses incurred\non or prior to December 31, 2019. Enstar' \u2018Ss subsidiary will provide $770 million ofe cover in excess of $3. \u2018805 billion retention\npayable under this contract, will be allocated across the various operating subsidiaries within the Aspen Group based on risk\nadjusted reserve run off projections. Completion of the transaction is subject to Board approvals and satisfaction of various\n\nother closing conditions. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2020.\n\nOn 26 March 2020, Standard & Poor's announced that they had downgraded their ratings on AIUK to A- outlook stable from\nAoutlook negative. The Company has taken clear steps to improve performance, strengthen the balance sheet and capital\n\u2018position, and insulate itself from future losses.on older accident years through the adverse development reinsurance cover\nreferred to above. S&P have acknowledged these changes and simultaneously upgraded the Aspen Group's financial risk\nprofile from \u2018satisfactory' to \u2018strong' and its capital and earnings from \u2018very strong' to \u2018excellent'. On April 1, 2620, A.M.\n\nBest affirmed the financial strength rating of \u201cA\u201d (Excellent) for AIUK but revised its outlook to negative from stable. The\nCompany does not believe that these rating actions will in any way compromise our ability to service the needs of our\ncustomers and trading partners or our obligations to them.\n", "Aspen Insurance UK Limited - Report and Accounts\nRegistered Number: 1184193\n\n\u201cFinancial Results\nThe financial results for the Company reflect a profit before tax for the year of $8.6m (2018: loss of $39.2m). This comprised:\n+ an underwriting loss before investment income of $85.0m (2018: $89.2m loss);\n- other expenses of $21.8m (2018: other income of $51.5m); offset by\n- an investment retum of $115.4m (2018: investment loss of $1.9m).\nThe underwriting loss of $85.0m (2018: $89.2m loss) reflected a $79.0m loss in the Company's reinsurance segment and a\n$6.0m loss in the insurance segment.\n\nThe reinsurance segment loss included Catastrophe losses associated with Typhoons Hagibis and Faxai ($16.8m and $9.9m\nrespectively) and a $13.9m loss in Credit & Surety from the failure of Thomas Cook. There was additional prior year\ndeterioration on Typhoon Jebi and onthe US Casualty, satellite and bloodstock books, which was partially offset by favourable\ndevelopment on Intemational Casualty. The $79.0m reinsurance segment underwriting loss in 2019 increased from a loss of\n$73.5m in 2018. The prior year saw a number of material Cat events.\n\nThe $6.0m insurance segment loss in 2019 reflected adverse prior year development on Marine & Energy Liability and\nAccident & Health lines. Due to this deterioration, we ceased underwriting Marine & Energy Liability in February 2020 and\nAccident & Health lines in March 2020. The overall insurance segment loss in 2018 was $15.7m.\n\n\u2018Other expenses of $21.8m related principally to foreign exchange losses.\n\nThe investment return of $115.4m (2018: $1.9m loss), included income from government and corporate bonds and other\ninvestments of $60.0m (2018: $62. im). The main reason for the significant increase in the overaii return in 2019 was\nunrealised gains in the value of financial instruments (principally government and corporate bonds) of $55.9m, compared\nto an unrealised loss in 2018 of $25.2m. The gains were driven by movements in US interest rates.\n\nThe Company met its ratings agency and regulatory capital requirements throughout 2019 and remains adequately capitalised\nfor the future. As at 31 December 2019, the Company was a direct subsidiary undertaking of Aspen European Holdings\nLimited (\u2018AEHL\u201d), a wholly owned subsidiary of AIHL. AEHL's registered office is 30 Fenchurch Street, London, EC3M\n3BD.\n\nFor 2020, ATUK will continue to focus on its chosen markets, seeking a positive return through focused underwriting and\nclient service.\n", "Aspen Insurance UK Limited - Report and Accounts\nRegistered Number: 1184193\n\nOverview of the Business\n\n\u2018The Company is authorised by the United Kingdom Prudential Regulation Authority to underwrite all eighteen classes of\ninsurance and reinsurance business.

These ratios\nare relative measurements that describe, for every $100 of net premiums earned, the amount of losses and loss adjustment\nexpenses, and the amount of other underwriting expenses that would be incurred.\n\nReinsurance Segment\nThe reinsurance segment consists of property, casualty and specialty reinsurance. A more detailed analysis of the business\nwritten within these classes is as follows:\n\nProperty Catastrophe Reinsurance\n\nProperty catastrophe reinsurance is generally written on a treaty excess of loss basis where the Company provides protection\nto an insurer for an agreed portion of the total losses from a single event in excess of a specified loss amount. In the event\nof a loss, most contracts provide for coverage of a second occurrence following the payment of a premium to reinstate the\ncoverage under the contract, which is referred to as a reinstatement premium. The coverage provided under excess of loss\nreinsurance contracts may be on a worldwide basis or limited in scope to selected regions or geographical areas.\n", "Aspen Insurance UK Limited - Report and Accounts\nRegistered Number: 1184193\n\nOther Property Reinsurance\n\nOther property reinsurance includes Property risks written on excess of loss and proportional treaties, facultative or single\nrisk reinsurance. Risk excess of loss reinsurance provides coverage to a reinsured where it experiences a loss in excess of\nits retention level on a single \u201crisk basis. A \u201crisk\u201d in this context might mean the insurance coverage on one building or a\ngroup of buildings for fire or explosion or the insurance coverage under a single policy which the reinsured treats as a single\nrisk. This line of business is generally less exposed to accumulations of exposures and losses but can stilt be impacted by\nnatural catastrophes, such as earthquakes and hurricanes.\n\nProportional treaty reinsurance provides proportional coverage to the reinsured, meaning that, subject to event limits where\napplicable and ceding commissions, the Company pays the same share of the covered original losses as itreceives in premiums\ncharged for the covered risks. Proportional contracts typically involve close client relationships which often include regular\naudits of the cedants' data.\n\nCasualty Reinsurance\n\nCasualty reinsurance is written on an excess of loss, proportional and facultative basis and consists of U.S. treaty, international\ntreaty and casualty facultative reinsurance. The Company's U.S. treaty business comprises exposures to workers'\ncompensation (including catastrophe), medical malpractice, general liability, auto liability, professional liability and excess\nliability including umbrella liability. The Company's intemational treaty business reinsures exposures mainly with respect\nto general liability, auto liability, professional liability, workers' compensation and excess liability.\n\nSpeciaity Reinsurance\n\nSpecialty reinsurance is written on an excess of loss and proportional basis and consisted of credit and surety reinsurance,\nagriculture reinsurance, mortgage reinsurance and i insurance, marine, aviation, terrorism, engineering, cyber and other\nspecialty lines.

These investments,\nincluding liquidity funds, are currently managed by the following investment managers and custodians:\n\nAlliance Capital Management L.P. BNP Paribas\n\nConning Asset Management Limited DWS Investment Management Americas Inc.\nBlackrock Financial Management, Inc Goldman Sachs Asset Management L.P.\nBNY Mellon Asset Servicing UBS AG\n\nCIBC Mellon Manufacturers.and Traders Trust Company\nCitibank Apollo Asset Management Europe PC LLP\n\nThe Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage foreign exchange risk and asset and liability matching as part\nof our strategy of efficient portfolio management.\n\nBalance Sheet\nThe balance sheet of the Company shows total assets of $6,502.2m (2018: $6,25 1.1m) and shareholder's equity of $841.9m\n(2018: $845.0m). Of the total assets, $2,442.7m, 38% (2018: $2,437.5m, 39%) was represented by financial investments.\n\nEnterprise Risk Management and Control Framework\n\nThe Board ensures that the Company operates an effective risk management and. control framework, which includes risk\nmanagement, compliance and internal control systems. The Company maintains appropriate policies, procedures and internal\ncontrols to support the risk and contro! framework. ~\n\nPrincipal Risks and Uncertainties\n\nRisk management has been embedded in the management and culture of the Aspen Group since its formation in 2002.\nThe Company, as an operating entity within the Aspen Group, operates within the Group's established risk management\npractices:\n\nThe key risks for the Company are:\n\n* Coronavirus - the impacts of Coronavirus on our clients and the markets in which we operate, our investments (as\na result of the impacts on the wider economy) and our operations could be material. These impacts are evolving,\nand inherently difficult to assess. We are in active correspondence with the PRA about the potential impact of\nCoronavirus on the Company and this will remain the case over coming weeks and months.\n\n* Underwriting performance. Although market conditions are improving losses in 2019 highlight that achievement\nof: \u2018appropriate underwriting performance remains a key risk to the company. Portfolio managementand risk selection\ntemain the key mitigant to this risk.\n\n* Expense management. A number of initiatives to reduce expenses were implemented i in 2017 and 2018 and the\nbenefits of this work are starting to come through. However, it is worth emphasising the decision to exit jines (Aspen\nRisk Management Limited, Marine and Energy Liability, Accident and Health, Marine Hull, Aviation and the Credit\nand Surety reinsurance business) and the associated loss of premium income places greater pressure on the expense\nratio of the business. The decision to exit lines of business and the recent rating agency actions mean that expense\nmanagement remains a key focus for the Company, and the business will review whether the same resources in\nsupport and operational areas are still required.\n\n+ Impacts of organisational change. Following the takeover of the Aspen Group by Apolio there has been and continues\nto be a significant level of organisational change. The level of organisational change means that the company\ncontinues to face a heightened exposure to operational risk\n\nRisk Management approach\n\nAJUK maintains: a Risk Universe which defines the different types of risk that the Company faces and how they are monitored\nand measured. This framework has been applied and refined throughout the intervening years. The Company operates an\nintegrated. enterprise wide risk management strategy designed to deliver shareholder value in a sustainable and. efficient\nmanner while providing a high level of policyholder protection. The Company's Risk Committee provides enhanced oversight\nof the Company's risk management process. The execution of the Company's integrated risk management strategy is based\non:\n", "Aspen Insurance UK Limited - Report and Accounts\nRegistered Number: 1184193\n\nthe establishment and maintenance of an internal control and risk management system based on a three lines of\ndefence approach to the allocation of responsibilities between risk accepting units (first line), risk management\nactivity and oversight from other central control functions (second fine) and independent assurance (third line);\nidentifying material risks to the achievement of the Company's objectives including emerging risks;\n\nthe articulation at Group and Company ievel of our risk appetite and a consistent set of key risk limits for each\nmaterial component of risk;\n\nmeasuring, monitoring, managing and reporting risk positions and trends;\n\nthe use, subject to an understanding of its limitations, of the Internal Model to test strategic and tactical business\ndecisions and to assess compliance with the Risk Appetite Statement and some risk limits; and\n\nstress and scenario testing, including reverse stress testing, designed to help the Company better understand and\ndevelop contingency plans for the likely effects of extreme events or combinations of events on capital adequacy\nand liquidity.\n\nOn 5 December 2015, the PRA approved the Company's Internal Model, which AIUK uses within its integrated risk\nmanagement system, to calculate its Solvency I Regulatory Capital Requirement (\"SCR\").\n\nRisk Appetite\n\nIn order to meet the expectations of its equity stakeholder, ATUK aims to maintain a level of profitability consistent with the\nGroup return targets set out in the Group Risk Appetite statement, taking into account the contributions of other subsidiaries.\nAIUK also aims to generate sufficient distributable income to allow it to contribute its share of funding for the debt and\ndividend obligations of the Aspen Group. The AIUK risk appetite and risk management process is aimed at ensuring that\nthese objectives are met. The Risk Appetite statement approved. by the Board articulates the Risk Appetite in terms of the\nfollowing components:\n\nRisk Preferences\n\na high level description of the iypes of risks ATUK prefers to assume and avoid within the\ncontext.of our objectives;\n\nCapital Constraint a minimum level of risk adjusted capital; and\nVolatility Constraint a basis for monitoring volatility of return.\n\nIn addition to the high level Risk Appetite statement the Company has established a set of Key Risk Limits covering exposures\nto natural and man-made catastrophe events, market risks, credit risks and operational risks. These are monitored and reported\nagainst to the Risk Committee on a quarterly basis. The risks are defined in the Risk Universe at 3 levels:\n\n.\n\nMain risk classification\nRisk category.\nRisk sub category\n\nThe main risks faced by the Company are defined as follows:\n\nCore risks -. those.risks inherent in the running of the Company's business are-listed below:\n\n)\n\n2)\n\nInsurance risk: The variation of actual technical results relating both to exposures from business written in the\nperiod (underwriting risk) and exposures from business written in prior periods (reserving risk) from their expected,\nvalues other than as a result of execution, operational or counterparty risks.\n\nMarket risk: The risk of variation in the fair value of our investment portfolio, cash and cash equivalents and\nderivative contracts including the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nNon-core risks are all risks other than core risks. These are quantified as far as possible and, wherever practical, minimised\nor avoided. These are listed below:\n\n3)\n\n4)\n5)\n\n6)\n\n7)\n\nCredit risk: The risk of diminution in the value of insurance and reinsurance receivables as a result of counter-party\ndefauit.\n\nLiquidity Risk: The risk that the Company is unable to make payments or provide collateral when required.\nOperational Risk: The risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, personnel or systems, or\nfrom external events.\n\nStrategic Risk: The risk of adverse impact on shareholder value or income and capital of adverse business decisions,\npoor execution or failure to respond to market changes.\n\nEmerging Risk: The risk that events not previously identified emerge and impact the profitability and / or balance\nsheet of the Company.\n\n10\n", "Aspen Insurance UK Limited - Report and Accounts\nRegistered Number: 1184193\n\n8) Regulatory Risk: The risk of non-compliance with regulatory requirements including ensuring ASUK understand\nand comply with changes to those requirements is managed as an operational risk. There is a residual risk that\n__ changes in regulation impact AIUK's ability to operate profitably i in some jurisdictions or some lines of business.\n9) Taxation Risk: The risk that we do not understand, pian for and manage ATUK's tax obligations is addressed as an\noperational risk. There is a residual risk that changes in taxation impact AIUK's ability to operate profitably in some\njurisdictions or some lines of business.\nOperational risk is the most complex of the non-core risk classifications because it includes multiple risk scenarios arising\nfrom multiple processes and circumstances. Because of this AIUK records identified operational risks and their related risk\nassessments, owners and identified controls in a separate \u2018Operational Risk Register' of the Company. The approach for\nthe Company operational risk register is monitored via a quarterly review process. We consider conduct risk as part of\noperational risk and have specific processes to address it including a conduct risk forum and a specific quarterly conduct\nrisk report to the AIUK Risk Committee.\n\nU.K.'s Decision to leave the EU\nThe United Kingdom's decision to withdraw from the E.U. could adversely impact our business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\n\nThe Company faces new regulatory costs and challenges as a result of the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European\nUnion (commonly known as \u201cBrexit\u201d). The U.K. left the E.U. as of January 31, 2020. A transitional arrangement, under\nwhich E.U. law will broadly remain in force in the U.K. is in place until December 31, 2020.

(including in\nrelation to trade and services) upon expiration of the transitional arrangement has caused, and is likely to cause, increased\neconomic volatility .and market uncertainty globally, in particular volatility of currency exchange rates, interest rates and\ncredit spreads. As well as short-term issues, the long-term effect of Brexit on the value of AFUK's investment portfolio at\nthis time is uncertain, and such volatility and uncertainty will likely continue as negotiations progress to determine the future\nterms of the U.K.'s relationship with the B.U.\n\nBrexit could lead to potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which E.U. laws to replace\nor replicate. ATUK may have to review its underwriting platforms and incur additional regulatory costs as a result. ATUK\nwill tose its EEA financial services passport which provides it with the license to operate across borders within the single\nEEA market without obtaining local regulatory approval where insurers and cedants are located. In addition, depending on\nthe terms agreed with the E.U. following the conclusion of the transitional arrangement, the U.K.'s regulatory regime in\nterms of Solvency II regulation and governance could also diverge and no longer be equivalent.\n\nClimate change\n\nGlobal climate change may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition and as a result\nthe Company is focused on adequately assessing and pricing (wherever possible) for any increased frequency and severity\nof catastrophes resulting from these environmental factors.\n\nThere is widespread consensus in the scientific community that there is a long-term upward trend i in global air and sea\ntemperatures which is likely to increase the severity and frequency of severe weather events.over the coming decades. Rising\nsea levels are also expected to add to the risks associated with coastal flooding in many geographical areas. Large scale\nclimate change could also increase both the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes and our total claims paid and all\nother costs associated with property damage and business interruption due to storms, floods and other weather-related events.\n\nIn addition, global climate change could impair our ability to predict the costs associated with future weather events and\ncould also give rise to new environmental liability claims in the energy, manufacturing and other industries we serve.\n\nGiven the scientific uncertainty of predicting the effect of climate cycles and climate change on the frequency and severity\nof catastrophes and the lack of adequate predictive tools, we may not be able to adequately model the associated exposures\nand potential losses in connection with such catastrophes which could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition or operating results.\n\nOur investment portfolio and our credit and political risk underwriting exposures may be materially adversely affected\nby global climate change regulation.\n\nWoild t\u00e9adeis fet at the 2015 United Nations Climat\u00e9 Change Coifer\u00e9nce ih Deceinber 201\u00b05 in Paris ad agreed to\n\nat\n", "Aspen Insurance UK Limited - Report and Accounts\nRegistered Number: 1184193\n\nlimit global greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere to a level which would not increase the average global\ntemperature by more than 2\u00b0Celsius, with an aspiration of limiting such increase to 1.5\u00b0 Celsius (the \u201cParis Agreement\u201d).\nIn order for governments to achieve their existing and future international commitments to limit the concentration of\ngreenhouse gases under the Paris Agreement, there is widespread consensus in the scientific community that a significant\npercentage of existing proven fossil fuel reserves may not be consumed. In addition, divestment campaigns, which call\non asset owners to divest from direct ownership of commingled funds that include fossil fuel equities and bonds, likewise\nsignals a change in society's attitude towards the social and environmental extemalities of doing business.\n\nAs a result of the above, energy companies and other companies engaged in the production or storage of fossil fuels\nmay experience unexpected or premature devaluations or write-ofts of their fossil fuel reserves. As at December 31,\n2019, we had $42.0 million, or 1.6% of our Managed Portfolio, invested in the energy sector. Government policies to\nslow global climate change by, for example, setting limits on carbon emissions may also have an adverse impact on\nother sectors, such as utilities, transportation and manufacturing. A material change in the asset value of fossil fuels or\nthe securities of energy companies and companies in these other sectors may therefore materially adversely affect our\ninvestment portfolio and our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe provide credit and politicai risk insurance to banks and other institutions providing lending to government and private\norganisations. In some cases the lending relates to private organisations involved in the energy sector or governments\nor government agencies which are dependent on fossil fuels for their revenue. A material change in the asset value of\nfossil fuels may therefore materially adversely affect our exposures to credit and political risk.\n\nCoronavirus Outbreak\n\nWe continue to closely monitor developments related to the outbreak of EOVID-19, also nown as coronavirus, to assess\nany potential impact on our business. Like many property and casualty (re)insurers, we have possible exposure to the\ncontingency market and cancellation losses stemming from the COVID-19 outbreak and could also face COVID-19 related\nclaims from creditand surety lines and potential exposure from business interruption. Whether the virus could trigger coverage\nis dependent on specific policy language, terms and exclusions. There is a risk, however, that legislative, regulatory, judicial\nor social influences may extend coverage beyond our intended contractual obligations or result in an increase in the frequency\nor severity of claims beyond expected ievels. The volatility in the financial markets resulting from the outbreak may also\nimpact our investment portfolio. Our investment portfolio comprises primarily government and other fixed income securities\nand we are not significantly exposed to equity markets. However, our corporate bond portfolio could be subject to valuation\nrisk as a result of movements in corporate spreads and default risk in the event of extended disruption to trade. In addition,\nexisting and potential future travel bans, preventative or government mandated closures of our offices or the offices of our\noutsource providers may affect our ability to conduct our business. A prolonged period of commercial disruption, reduced\neconomic activity and other consequences of the outbreak could have a material impact on our resuits of operations, financial\ncondition or liquidity. It is not practicable to quantify the ultimate financial effect of the outbreak on the Company at this\n\nstage.\n\n\u2018The Board has undertaken an assessment to determine the impact of COVID-19 on the company and its future viability.\nThis assessment has included a review of potential insurance and investment exposures under moderate and severe scenarios\nand regular monitoring of current and projected solvency levels. The scenarios encompass different assumed durations of\nthe effects of the outbreak, credit spreads widening by upto 400-600 basis points, yields on the investment portfolio dropping\nto nil for these different durations and an estimate of (re)insurance losses by reviewing various business lines where exposures\nare likely (direct and indirectly) and quantifying the estimated loss exposures. This analysis was supplemented by a reverse\nstress test to determine the level of, and likelihood of, capital erosion that would result in an adverse impact on the Company's\nability to satisfy regulatory capital thresholds.\n\nAdditional sensitivities have been provided on page 43 to capture the impact of widening credit spreads and interest rate\nmovements on our fixed income portfolio at 31 March 2020 to support our ongoing assessment.\n\nWe continue to monitor our solvency and capital position closely on a frequent basis post year end. Based on our analysis\nand our latest post year end estimate of the solvency position the Company's capital resources remain comfortably in excess\nof the relevant regulatory capital thresholds and | projected to do so under severe scenarios; the reverse stress test indicates\nthat the ievel at which an adverse impact would arise on the Company's ability to satisfy regulatory capital thresholds is\nsufficiently remote. Accordingly the Directors have concluded that although the impact from COVID-19 is likely to be\nmaterial it does not adversely affect the company's ability to continue as a going concern or reduce its capital and solvency\nlevels to below regulatory requirements. Our priority remains to support our staff and honour our client's needs.\n\n12\n", "Aspen Insurance UK Limited - Report and Accounts\nRegistered Number: {184193\n\nAgency Ratings\n\nRatings with respect to claims paying ability and financial strength have become increasingly important factors in establishing\nthe competitive position of insurance and reinsurance companies and will also impact the cost and availability of capital to\nan insurance company. Ratings by AM. Best and Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC (\u201cS&P*) represent an important\nconsideration in maintaining customer confidence in us and in our ability to market insurance products.

Because S&P continually monitors\ncompanies with regard to their ratings, our ratings could change at any time. The Company does not believe that these rating\nactions will in any way compromise our ability to service the needs of our customers and trading partners or our obligations\nto them. However, the downgrade may impair our ability to sell insurance policies and could materially and adversely affect\nour competitive position in the insurance industry, future financial condition and operating results.\n\nSection 172 statement\n\nThe Board factored the needs and concems of the Company's stakeholders into its decisions in accordance with section 172\nof the Companies Act 2006. The importance of the Company' 's stakeholders are outlined in more specific detail within the\nDirectors' report, however examples of key decisions taken by the Board during 3019 include:\n\n\u00b0 Key strategic changes - Following the Apollo Acquisition, there have been a number of changes to executives and\nsenior management, including the appointment of several new \u2018Non-Executive Directors. Acompiete strategic review\nofthe Company's business and culture was also undertaken, in order to improve underwriting performance, financial\nstrength and the culture for employees across the Aspen Group. As a result, various changes have been implemented,\n\nincluding:\n\n\u00b0 Underwriting - Ongoing refinement of the Company's underwriting portfolio, which resulted in the\nCompany exiting the Credit & Surety Line of Business in 2019.\n\n. Structural Changes - Closure of the Company's Irish and Dubai branches. However, the Company\n\ncontinues to service some of the business from those branches in London and its Zurich Branch. The\nAspen Group aiso closed its Lioyd's China Platform as a result of which, some of this business wili now\nbe serviced by the Company's Singapore Branch.\n\n* Investment - Implementation of a new investment strategy.\n\n. Cuitural - As outlined in detail under the Climate Change, Charitable and Political Donations and\nStakeholder Engagement sections of this report, the Company in conjunction with the wider Aspen Group\nis seeking to make changes that will benefit its employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders and the\ncommunity as a whole.\n\n\u00a2  On14 May 2019, ATUK issued notice to terminate the delegated underwriting authority to ARML. In August 2019,\nwe placed. the ARML business into runoff. AIUK has assumed ARML's underwriting administration and claims\nhandling obligations for the run-off business.\n\n+ Brexit \u201cThe Company has considered various strategic-options in order to serve business in the EEA post the UK\nleaving the EU, and expiry of the transition period. The Company has decided not to proceed with its application\nfor an Irish Branch and is focused instead on discussions with various EU regulators. The impact of Brexit on the\nCompany and how the Company has managed this, is discussed more comprehensively in the section of the report:\nThe UK's Decision to leave the EU.\n\n\u00a2 Head Office refurbishment - The Company renewed its Lease of 30 Fenchurch Street and has commenced\nrefurbishment of the premises.\n\nThe Company is firmiy committed to high standards of corporate governance and maintaining a sound framework for the\ncontrol and management of the business.

The majority of the Company's UK personnel are employed by\nAspen Insurance UK Services Limited (\u201cATUKS\u201d). ATUKS is a fellow subsidiary of AIHL. However, the Company' S\ninitiatives are serviced by AIUKS employees by way of an intra Group Service Agreement. There are a smaii number of\nemployees employed by the Zurich Branch of ATUK.

Such opportunities, as well as career development and\npromotion, are equally available to disabled employees, whether newly recruited or existing employees who become disabled\nwhilst in AIUKS's employment.\n\nAIUKS's equal opportunities policy aims to ensure that no potential or existing employee receives less favourable treatment\nbecause of his / her sex, actual or perceived sexual orientation, gender (including gender reassignment), marital or family\nstate, age, ethnic origin, disability, race, colour, nationality, national origin, creed, political affirmation, part-time status, or\nany other condition, unless it can be shown to be legally justifiable.\n\nGoing Concern\n\nThe Directors confirm that they are satisfied that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operation and meet its\nliabilities as they fall due for a period of at least 12 months from the date that the financial statements are approved. In\narriving at this conclusion, as explained in further detail on page 12, the Directors have undertaken an assessment to determine\n\n15\n", "Aspen Insurance UK Limited - Report and Accounts\nRegistered Number: 1184193\n\nthe impact of COVID-19 on the company and its future viability, taking into account the likely impact on the Company's\ninsured loss exposures, investments and solvency capital position under moderate and severe scenarios, and the associated\nsensitivities where relevant. This is supplemented as appropriate, by reverse stress testing to determine the extent to which\ncapital erosion would have to occur to result in an adverse impact on the Company's ability to meet certain regulatory capital\nrequirements. The analysis performed demonstrates that the Company remains solvent and retains sufficient headroom above\nregulatory capital requirements under moderate and severe scenarios; the reverse stress test indicates | that the likelihood of\nthere being capital erosion to such an extent as to breach the company's regulatory capital requirements is sufficiently remote.\n\nAccordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.\n\nCharitable and Politicai Donations .\n\nThe Company made charitable donations during the year of $0.3 million (2018: $0.4 million). The donations were to\norganisations engaged in cancer research, children with disability, providing food to the underprivileged, ex-service men\nand women with disabilities and to a community project in Uganda. There were no political donations made during the year.\n\nStakeholder engagement _\n\nThere is a growing recognition within the insurance industry of the value of high-quality stakeholder relationships. The\nCompany embraces this trend recognising that active stakeholder input helps to drive the legitimacy and sustainability of its\nbusiness strategy.

At a strategic level,\nmethods of engagement can vary depending on the issue and the business unit involved. However, senior leaders regularly\nand actively participate in regulatory, industry and claims forums, listening to the perspectives of brokers, employees,\npolicyholders and suppliers.

This was due to significant\ndeterioration on prior years and loss activity in the current year in a market where pricing is not correcting sufficiently enough.\nThis marketplace has not generated sustainable profit \u2018margins, and we are \u2018shifting our focus to areas where we believe there\nis better opportunity to.achieve our long-term profitability targets. In addition, the Company exited the Accident & Health\nline in March 2020 due to adverse claims experience and uncertain sustainable profitability of this type of business with\nhigh acquisition and operating costs.\n\nOn March 2, 2626, AIHL entered into an adverse development reinsurance agreement with Cavello Bay Reinsurance Limited\n(\u201cCavello\u201d), a Bermuda insurance company and wholly owned subsidiary of Enstar Group Limited.

Our\nresponsibilities are described below. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is a sufficient and appropriate basis\nfor our opinion. Our audit opinion is consistent with our report to the Audit Committee.\n\n\u2018We were appointed as auditor by the Directors in'2002. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is for the 18 financial\nyears ended 2019. We have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and we remain independent of the Company in\naccordance with, UK ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard as applied to public interest entities. No non-\naudit services prohibited by that Standard were provided.\n\n2 Key audit matters: our assessment of risks of material misstatement\n\n\u2018Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial\n\u2018statements and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified\nby us, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and\ndirecting the efforts of the engagement team. We summarise below the key audit matters, in decreasing order of audit\nsignificance, in arriving at our audit opinion above, together with our key audit procedures to address those matters and, as\nrequired for public interest entities, our results from those procedures. These matters were addressed, and our results are\nbased on procedures undertaken, in the context of, and:solely for the purpose of, our audit of the financial statements as a\nwhole, and in forming our-opinion thereon, and consequently are incidental to that opinion, and we do not provide a separate\nopinion on these matters.\n\nWe continue to perform procedures over the provision for uneamed premiums and insurance receivables in respect of\nproportional treaty premiums. However, in respect of these areas based on the results of our test work in 2018 and the lack\nof any significant estimation uncertainty we have not assessed these as one of the most significant risks in our current year\naudit and, therefore, they have not been separately identified in our report this year.\n\n21\n", "paration) and\n206SONE\n\nUnprecedented levels of uncertainty\n\nThe financial statements explain how the\nDirectors have formed their judgement that it is\nappropriate to adopt the going concem basis of\npreparation for the Company.\n\nThe judgement is based on an evaluation of the\ninherent risks to the Company's business model\nand how those risks might affect the Company's\nfinancial resources or ability to continue\noperations over a period of at least a year from\nthe date of approval of the financial statements.\n\nThe impact of COVID-19 is subject to\nunprecedented levels of uncertainty of\noutcomes, with the full range of possible effects\nunknown given the rapidly evolving nature of|\nthe situation on financial and operational\nperformance.\n\nThe risks that we considered most tikely to\nadversely affect the Company's available\nfinancial resources over this period were:\n\n~ Adverse loss experience;\n\n- A deterioration in the valuation of\ninvestments; and\n\n+The length of time that the impact of\n\nCOVID-19 will cause disruption to\n\neconomic conditions and result in the\n\ndevelopment of insured losses\n\nThere are also Jess predictable but realistic\nsecond order impacts, such as the failure of\ncounterparties who have transactions with the\nCompany (such as banks and reinsurers) to meet\ncommitments that could give rise to a negative\nimpact on the Company's financial position and\nthe impact of COVID-19 on the economic\nenvironment and the resulting impact on the\nCompany's capital resources.\n\nThe risk for our audit was whether or not those\ntisks were such that they amounted to a material\nuncertainty that cast significant doubt about the\nability to continue as a going concem. Had they\nbeen such, then that fact would have been\nrequired to have been disclosed.\n\nDisclosure quality\n\nClear and full disclosure of the assessment\nundertaken by the Directors and the rationale\nfor the use of the going concern assumption,\nrepresents a key financial statement disclosure\nrequirement.\n\nThere is a risk that insufficient details are\ndisclosed to allow a full understanding of the\nassessment undertaken by the Directors.\n\nAspen Insurance UK Limited - Report and Accounts.\n\ndue to COVID-19 on our audit\n5-16 (Go!\n\nnmi even\n\nOnCErA-StaeEMeNL)- pay\n\nOur procedures included:\nOur COVID-19 understanding\n\nWe considered the Directors' assessment of the risks and\nimpact of COVID-19 and compar\u00e9d these to our own\nunderstanding of the risks.\n\nSensitivity analysis\n\nWe evaluated the Company's financial forecasts and\nconsidered sensitivities over the level of available financial\nTesources taking account of reasonably possible (but not\nunrealistic) adverse effects of COVID-19 that could arise over\nthe period, individually and collectively.\n\nWe consider\u00e9d the Directors' stress t\u00e9sting of critical factors\nsuch as the deterioration in the valuation of the Company's\ninvestments in corporate bonds, adverse loss experience on\nthe insured portfolio, and the duration of the outbreak. We\nalso assessed management's plans and progress to ensure the\ncontinued operation of the business in the face of the\ndisruption caused by COVID-19. Further, we evaluated the\ndegree to which reasonably foreseeable downside scenarios\nthat would impact the Company's business would be covered\nby the stress tests that the directors had used in its COVID-19\nassessment taking into consideration reverse stress tests\nperformed by the Directors to determine the level of capital\nerosion that could impact the Company's ability to meet its\nregulatory capita] requirements.\n\nEvaluating Directors' actions\n\nThrough enquiry we evaluated the extent to which actions\ntaken by Directors would improve the position as risks\nmaterialise.\n\nAssessing transparency\n\nWe critically assessed the completeness and accuracy of the\nmatters covered in the going concern disclosure by agreeing\nto supporting evidence and performing inquiries of the\nDirectors, which included challenging \u00a2 transparency of|\nassumptions in the severe but plausible downside scenarios\nperformed in making this assessment.\n\nOur results\n\nWe found the going concern disclosure without any\nmaterial uacertainty to be proportionate (2018:\nproportionate).\n\nHowever, no audit should be expected to predict the\nunknowable factors or all possible future implications for\na company and this is particularly the case in relation to\nCOVID-19,\n\n22\n\n", "Q019\n\nms Outstandis\n\nAspen Insurance UK Limited - Report and Accounts\n\nshn, 2018\n\nounting policy) and pa\n\ndetermination\nmethodology and\ncalculations are complex.\n\nCertain lines of business have greater inherent\nuncertainty, for example those where claims\nemerge more slowly over time, or where there\nis greater variability in claim settlement\namounts.

The appropriate level of margin to\nrecognise is a subjective judgement based on\nthe level of uncertainty and potential for\nvolatility in the claims experience.\n\nCase reserves for reported claims, whilst less\nsubjective, carry the risk of management bias\nthrough understatement of the level of reserves\nheld for open claims. Given the size of these\nreserves, and the consequent impact on the\ndevelopment factors used in the projection of\nthe IBNR, we consider this to form part of the\nkey audit matter.\n\nThe effect of these matters is that, as part of our\nrisk assessment, we determined that IBNR has\na high degree of estimation uncertainty, with a\npotential range of reasonable outcomes greater\nthan our materiality for the financial statements\nas a whole, and possibly many times that\namount.

The determination of which\nclasses to re-project was based on risk assessment and\nconsideration of the evidence available from other alternative\ndata analysis procedures.\n\nMethodology assessment in respect of margin\n\nWe evaluated the appropriateness of the Company's\nmethodology in respect of the margin applied to the actuarial\nbest estimate by comparing to our understanding of the\ndevelopment in uncertainties specific to the exposures in the\nCompany's portfolio. We assessed reserving strength, in\n\narticular the level of margin held, with reference to our\nindependently determined reasonable range and our\nprofessional judgement.\n\nTest of detail\n\nFor a sample of individual reported claims, we agreed the\nteserve booked to third party evidence such as loss\nnotification information from cedants and Joss adjuster\nreports.\n\nOur resuit\n\nWe found the valuation of the claims outstanding liability\nto be acceptable (2018: acceptable).\n\n23\n", "Written P\n\nRisk vs 201\n\nThe appropriateness of certain inward\nreinsurance premiums written, speciftcally\nrelating to proportional contracts, is an area of\naudit risk.

Materiality of $6.05m (2018: $9.50m), as\ncommunicated by the group audit team, has been applied to the audit of the Company. This is lower than the materiality we would otherwise\nhave determined by reference to Gross written premium, and represents 0.5% of the Company's Gross written premium (2018: 0.6%). Gross\nwritten premium has been selected as the benchmark due to its relative stability and correlation with business performance and size.\n\n\u2018We agreed to report to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding $0.30m (2018: $0.48m), in\naddition to other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.\n\nOur audit of the Company was performed at the Company's head office in London, the Bermuda and US office locations, and also included\nvisits by the audit team to the Company's third party service organisation's office in India\n\nOur audit of the Company was undertaken to the materiality level specified above.\n\nThe auditor of the parent company, Aspen Insurance Holdings Limited, performed testing on controls retating to outward reinsurance and\ntests of detail in relation to outwards reinsurance related balances in the financial statements. Audit teams in Bermuda and US performed\ntests of detail relating to investments and investment income (including realised and unrealised gains/losses on investments) and account\nbalances relating to business of the Company in the US, respectively. We instructed auditors in these locations as to the specific procedures\ntequired to be performed the information to be reported back.\n\nWe evaluated the scope of the work and the information reported back to ensure that it addressed the risks relevant to our audit.\n\n4 We have nothing to report on going concern\n\nThe Directors have prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis as they do not intend to liquidate the Company or to cease\nits operations, and as they have concluded that the Company's financial position means that this is realistic. They have also concluded that\n\n25\n", "there are no material uncertainties that could have cast significant doubt over its ability to continue as a going concer for at least a year\nfrom the date of approval of the financial statements (\u201cthe going concern period\u201d).\n\nOur responsibility is to conclude on the appropriateness of the Directors' conclusions and, had there been a material uncertainty related to\ngoing concern, to make reference to that in this audit report. However, as we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent\nevents may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the absence of\nreference to a material uncertainty in this auditor's report is not a guarantee that the Company will continue in operation.\n\nWe identified going concem as a key audit matter (see section 2 of this report). Based on the work described in our response to that key\naudit matter, we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors' statement\nin Note I to the financial statements on the use of the going concern basis of accounting with no material uncertainties that may cast\nsignificant doubt over the Company's use of that basis for a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial\nstatements.\n\nWe have nothing to report in these respects.\n\n\u00a7 We have nothing to report\u2018on the strategic \u2018report and the directors' report\nThe Directors are responsible for the strategic report and the directors' report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover those\nreports and we do not express an audit opinion thereon.\n\nOur responsibility is to read the strategic report and the directors' report and, in doing so, consider whether, based on our financial statements\naudit work, the information therein is materially misstated os inconsistent with the financial statements or our audit knowledge. Based\nsolely on that work:\n\n. we have not identified material misstatements in those reports;\n\n. in our opinion the information given in the strategic report and the directors' report for the financial year is consistent with the\nfinancial statements; and\n\n. in our opinion those reports have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.\n\n6 We have nothing to report on the other matters on which we are required to report by exception\n\nUnder the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:\n\n* \u2014 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches\nnot visited by us; or\n\n\u00b0 the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or\n\n\u00a2 certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or\n\n\u00b0 \u2014 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.\n\n\u2018We have nothing to report in these respects.\n7 Respective responsibilities\n\nDirectors' responsibilities\n\nAs explained more fully in their statement set out on page 20, the Directors are responsible for: the preparation of the financial statements\nincluding being satisfied that they give a true and fair view; such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation\nof financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing the Company's ability to continue\nas a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and using the going concer basis of accounting unless they\neither intend to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nAuditor's responsibilities\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement,\nwhether due to fraud or other irregularities (see below), or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor's report. Reasonable assurance is\na high levet of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material\nmisstatement when it-exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud, other irregularities or error and are considered material if, individually\nor in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.\n\nA fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC's website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.\n\nIrregularities - ability to detect\n\nWe identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the financial statements from our\n-general commercial and sector experience, through discussion with the Directors and other management (as required by auditing standards),\nand from inspection of the company's regulatory and legal correspondence and discussed with the Directors and other management the\npolicies and procedures regarding compliance with laws and regulations. We communicated identified taws and regulations throughout\n\nour team and remained alert to any indications of non-compliance throughout the audit.\n\nThe potential effect of these laws and regulations on the financial statements varies considerably.\n\n26\n", "Firstly, the company is subject to laws and regulations that directly affect the financial statements including financial reporting legislation\n(including related companies legislation), distributable profits legislation and taxation legislation and we assessed the extent of compliance\nswith these laws and regulations as part of our procedures on the related financial statement items.\n\nSecondly, the company is subject to many other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance could have a material\neffect on amounts or disclosures in the financial statements, for instance through the imposition of fines or litigation or the loss of company's\nlicence to operate. We identified the following areas as those most likely to have such an effect: regulatory capital and liquidity recognising\nthe financial and regulated nature of the company's activities and compliance with regulation relating to sanctions duc to the nature of the\nbusiness written by the Company and its customers. Auditing standards limit the required audit procedures to identify non-compliance\nwith these laws and regulations to enquiry of the Directors and other management and inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence,\nif any. These limited procedures did not identify actual or suspected non-compliance.\n\nOwing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we. may not have detected some material misstatements in\nthe financial statements, even though we have properly planned and performed our audit in accordance with auditing standards. For example,\nthe further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations (irregularities) is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial\nstatements, the tess likely the inherently limited procedures required by auditing standards would identify it. In addition, as with any audit,\nthere remained a higher risk of non-detection of irregularities, as these may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,\ntaisrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. We are not responsible for preventing non-compliance and cannot be expected to\ndetect non-compliance with all laws and regulations.\n\n8 The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe our responsibilities\n\nThis report is made solely to the Company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006.

Accounting Policies\n1.1 Statement of Compliance\n\nAspen Insurance UK Limited (the \u201cCompany\u201d).is a company limited by shares and-incorporated and domiciled in the UK.\nThe Registered Office is 30 Fenchurch Street, London EC3M 3BD.\n\nThese financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102: The Financial Reporting\nStandard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (\u201cFRS 102\u201d) and Financial Reporting Standard 103 (FRS 103\u201d),\nbeing applicable UK GAAP accounting standards and in accordance with Schedule 3 of the Large and Medium-sized\nCompanies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations relating to insurance companies.\n\nThese financial statements are prepared under historical cost convention except for certain financial instruments which are\nmeasured at fair value.\n\n1.2 Basis of Preparation\n\nThe financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019 were approved for issue by the Board of Directors on 12 May\n2020. The Directors confirm that they are satisfied that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operation\n\nand meet its liabilities as they fall due fora period of at least 12 months from the date that the financial statements are\napproved. Inarriving at this conclusion, as explained in further detail on page 12, the Directors have undertaken an assessment\nto determine the impact of COVID-19 on the company and its future viability, taking into account the likely impact on the\nCompany's insured loss exposures, investments and solvency capital position under moderate and severe scenarios, and the\nassociated sensitivities where relevant. This is supplemented as appropriate, by reverse stress testing to determine the extent\nto which capital erosion would have to occur to result in an adverse impact on the Company's ability to meet certain regulatory\ncapital requirements. The analysis performed demonstrates that the Company remains solvent and retains sufficient headroom\nabove regulatory capital requirements under moderate and severe scenarios; the reverse stress test indicates that the likelihood\nof there being capital erosion to such an extent as to breach the company's regulatory capital requirements is sufficiently\nremote.\n\nAccordingly, they continue to adopt the going concem basis in preparing the financial statements.\n\nThe presentation currency of these financial statements is US dollars. Given the company has annual gross written premium\nof more than $1 billion and net assets of over $800 million we consider it appropriate to present all amounts in the financial\nstatements to the nearest $0.1m.\n\nThe Company' '$ parent undertaking, Aspen Insurance Holdings Limited (\"ATHL IL\") includes the Company i in its consolidated\nfinancial statements. The consolidated financial statements of AIHL are prepared in accordance with US GAAP, available\nto the public and may be obtained from 141 Front Street, Hamilton, Bermuda. In these financial statements, the company is\nconsidered to be a qualifying entity (for the purposes of this FRS) and-has applied the exemptions available under FRS 102\nin respect of the following disclosures:\n\n* Reconciliation of the number of shares outstanding from the beginning to end of the period;\n+ Cash Flow Statement and related notes;\n\n* Requirements of Related Party Disclosures;.\n\n* Key Management Personnel compensation; and\n\n* Certain disclosures required by FRS 102.26 Share Based Payments.\n\nThe accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in\nthese financial statements.\n\nThe preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect\nthe amounts reported for assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet date and the amounts reported for revenues and expenses\nduring the year. However, the nature of estimation means that actual outcomes could differ from those estimates. The following,\nare the Company's key sources of estimation uncertainty and judgment:\n\nInsurance and reinsurance contract technical provisions\n\nFor insurance and reinsurance contracts, estimates have to be made both for the expected ultimate cost of claims reported\nat the reporting date and for the expected ultimate cost of claims incurred, but not yet reported (\"IBNR\"), at the reporting\ndate, for both gross and net of reinsurance recoveries. It can take a significant period of time before the ultimate claims cost\n\n32\n", "Aspen Insurance UK Limited - Report and Accounts\nRegistered Number: 1184193\n\ncan be established with certainty, and for some types of policies IBNR claims form the majority of the liability in the statement\nof financial position. The estimation of IBNR is discussed further under section 1.4.1 - Insurance Contracts: Technical\nProvisions.\n\nProvision for unearned premiums and deferred acquisition costs\n\nFor (re)insurance contracts management use their judgement in selecting appropriate earnings patterns for the business\nunderwritten and associated acquisition costs, in particular for contracts where the pattern of loss emergence is likely to be\nmarkedly uneven. Patterns are calculated (determined) with reference to the inception and expiry dates of the policies\nconcemed and the likely pattern of loss emergence using the same underlying considerations that apply to the technical\nprovisions, taking into consideration information provided by cedants on loss emergence where appropriate.\n\nEstimates of future premiums\n\nFor certain insurance contracts, premium is initially written based on estimates of ultimate premiums receivable. Estimates\nare derived from underwriter experience, historical data and broker estimation. These estimates are judgemental and could\nresult in adjustments in subsequent periods to revenue recorded in the financial statements. The main: assumption underlying\n\u2018these estimates is that past premium development can be used to project future premium development.\n\nTaxation\n\nThe Gompany establishes provisions based on reasonable estimates: The amount of such provisions is bas\u00e9d on various\nfactors, such as experience with previous tax audits and differing interpretations of tax regulations by the tax authority.\n\nManagement estimation is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon likely\ntiming.and level of future taxable profits together with an assessment of the effect of future tax planning strategies.\n\n1.4 Significant Accounting Policies\n\n1.4.1 Insurance contracts.\n\nGross Premiums\n\n\u2018Gross written premiums comprise total premiums receivable for the whole period of \u2018cover entered into inthe reporting period\nplus any adjustments to such premiums receivable in respect of business written in prior reporting periods. All premiums\nare shown gross of commissions payable to intermediaries and exclusive of taxes and levies.\n\nReinsurance Premiums\n\nReinsurance premiums relating to reinsurance placed by the Company are accounted for using the same accounting\nmethodology used for inwards premiums.\n\n- Acquisition Costs\n\nAcquisition costs represent commission brokerage, profit commission and other variable costs that relate directly to the\nsecuring of new contracts and renewal of existing contracts. They are generally deferred over the period in which the related\npremiums are earned.\n\nClaims\n\n\u201cClaims include all claims occurring during the year, whether reported or not, related internal and extemal claims handling\ncosts that are directly related to the processing and settlement of claims, a reduction for the value of salvage and other\nrecoveries, and any adjustments to claims outstanding from previous years.\n\nReinsurance claims are recognised when the related gross insurance claim is recognised according to the terms of the relevant\ncontract.\n\nTechnical Provisions\n\nTechnical provisions comprise claims outstanding, provisions for unearned premiums and provisions for unexpired risk.\nClaims provision\n\nThe outstanding claims provision is based on the estimated ultimate cost of all claims incurred but not settled at the reporting\ndate, whether reported or not, together with related claims handling costs and reduction for the expected value of salvage\ncand other recoveries. Delays can be experienced in the notification and settlement of certain types of claims, therefore, the\nultimate cost of these cannot be known with certainty at the reporting date. The Company takes all reasonable steps to ensure\n\n33\n", "Aspen Insurance UK Limited - Report and Accounts\nRegistered Number: 1184193\n\nthat it has appropriate information regarding its claims exposure. However, given the uncertainty in establishing claims\nprovisions, it is likely that the final outcome will prove to be different from the original liability established. The liability is\nnot discounted for the time value of money.\n\nFor insurance contracts, estimates have to be made both for the expected ultimate cost of claims reported at the reporting\ndate and for the expected ultimate cost of claims incurred, but not yet reported to the Company, at the reporting date: The\nestimation of IBNR is generally subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than the estimation of the cost of settling claims\nalready notified to the \u2018Company, where more information about the claim event is generally available. Claims IBNR may\noften not be apparent to the insured until many years after the event giving rise to the claims has happened. Classes of business\nwhere the IBNR proportion of the total reserve is high will typically display greater variations between initial estimates and\nfinal outcomes because of the greater degree of uncertainty of estimating these reserves. Classes of business where claims\nare typically reported relatively quickly after the claim event tend to display lower levels of volatility. In calculating the\nestimated cost of unpaid claims the Company uses a variety of estimation techniques, generally based upon statistical analyses\nof historical experience, which assumes that the development pattern of the current claims will be consistent with past\nexperience. Allowance is made, however, for changes or uncertainties which may create distortions in the underlying statistics\nor which might cause the cost of unsettled claims to increase or reduce when compared with the cost of previously settled\nclaims:\n\nAcomponent of these estimation techniques is usually the estimation of the cost of notified but not paid claims. In estimating\nthe cost of these claims, the Company has regard to the claim circumstance as reported, any information available from loss\nadjusters and information on the cost of-settling claims with similar characteristics in previous periods.\n\nLarge claims impacting each relevant business class are generally assessed separately, being measured on a case by case\nbasis or projected separately in order to allow for the possible distortive effect of the development and incidence of these\nlarge claims.\n\nWhere possible the Company adopts multiple techniques to estimate the required level of provisions. This assists in giving\ngreater understanding of the trends inherent in the data being projected. The projections given by the various methodologies\nalso assist in setting the range of possible outcomes. The most appropriate estimation technique is selected taking into account\nthe characteristics of the class and the extent of the development of each accident year. The main projection methodologies\nthat are used are:\n\n* Initial expected loss ratio(\u201cIELR\u201d) method: This method caiculates an estimate of ultimate losses by applying an estimated\nloss ratio to an estimate of ultimate earned premium for each accident year.\n\n* Bombuetter-Ferguson (\u201cBF\u201d) method: The BF method uses as a starting point an assumed IELR and blends in the loss\nratio implied by the claims experience to date by using benchmark loss development patterns on paid claims data (Paid\nBF\u201d) or reported claims data (\u201cReported BF\u201d).\n\n* Loss development (\u201cChain Ladder\u201d): This method uses actual loss data and the historical development profiles on older\naccident years to project more recent, less developed years to their uitimate position.\n\n\u00a2 Exposure-based method: This method is used for specific large typically catastrophic events such as a major hurricane.\nAll exposure is identified and we work with known market information and information from our cedants to determine\n\u2018a percentage of the exposure to be taken as the ultimate loss.\n\nIn addition to these methodologies, our actuaries may use other approaches depending upon the characteristics of the line\nof business and available data.\n\nProvisions for unearned premiums\n\nUnearned premiums are those proportions of premiums written in a year that relate to periods of risk after the reporting date\ncomputed separately for each insurance contract. Written premiums are recognised as eared over the period of the policy\non a time apportionment basis having regard where appropriate, to the incidence of risk. The proportion attributable to\nsubsequent periods is deferred as a provision for uneamed premiums.\n\nUneamed reinsurance premiums are those proportions of premiums written in a year that relate to periods of risk after the\nreporting date. Unearned reinsurance premiums are deferred over the term of the underlying direct insurance policies for\nrisks-attaching contracts and over the term of the reinsurance contract for losses-occurring contracts.\n\nUnearned premiums are deemed monetary items and are valued using the closing rate.\nUnexpired risks\n\nA liability adequacy provision (the unexpired risks provision) is made where the cost of claims and expenses arising after\nthe end of the financial year from contracts concluded before that date, is expected to exceed the provision for unearned\npremiums, net of deferred acquisition costs, and premiums receivable.\n\n34\n", "Aspen Insurance UK Limited - Report and Accounts\nRegistered Number: 1184193\n\n\u2018The assessment of whether a provision is necessary is made by considering separately each category of business on the basis\nof information available at the reporting date, after offsetting surpluses and deficits arising on products which are managed\ntogether. Investment income is taken into account in calculating the provision.\n\nDeferred acquisition costs\n\nAcquisition costs arising from the conclusion of insurance contracts are deferred commensurate with the unearned premium\nprovision. Deferred acquisition costs are deemed to be monetary items and are valued using the closing rate.\n\nReinsurance assets\n\nThe Company cedes insurance risk in the normal course-of business for all of its businesses. Reinsurance assets represent\nbalances due from reinsurance companies. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with\nthe outstanding claims provision or settled claims associated with the reinsurer's policies and are in accordance with the\nrelated reinsurance contract.\n\nReinsurance assets are reviewed for impairment at each 1 reporting \u00ab date, or more frequently, when an indication of impairment\narises during the reporting year. impairment occurs when there is objective evidence as a result of an event that occurred\nafter initial recognition of the reinsurance asset that the Company may not receive all outstanding amounts due under the\nterms of the contract and the event has a reliably measurable impact on the amounts that the Company will receive from the\nreinsurer. The impairment loss is recorded in the income statement.\n\nInsurance receivables\nInsurance receivables are recognised when due and measured on initial recognition at the fair value of the consideration\nreceived or receivable. The carrying value of insurance receivables is reviewed for impairment whenever events or\n\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, with the impairment loss recorded in the income\nstatement.\n\nInsurance payables :\n\ninsurance payables are recognised when due and measured on initial recognition at the fair value of the consideration received\nless directly attributable transaction costs. Insurance payables are derecognised when the obligation under the liability is\nsettled, cancelled or expired.\n\n14.2 Finaiicial listruments\n\nAs permitted by FRS 102, the Company has elected to apply the recognition and measurement provisions of IAS 39 Financial _\nInstruments to account for ail of its financial instruments.\n\nThe Company classifies its financial assets into the following categories: Equity instruments and other variable-yield securities\n-- at fair value through profit or loss and Deposits with credit institutions - loans and receivables. Management determines\nthe classification of its investments at initial recognition and re-evaluates this at every reporting date.\n\nFinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss\n\nA financial asset is classified into this category if it is acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term, if it\nforms part of a portfolio of financial assets in which there is evidence of short term profit-taking, or if so designated by\nmanagement to minimise any measurement or recognition inconsistency with associated liabilities:\n\nFinancial assets designated as at \u201cfair value through profit and loss\" at inception are those that are managed and whose\nperformance is evaluated on a fair value basis. Information about these financial assets is provided internally on a fair value\nbasis to the Company's key management personnel: The Company's investment strategy is to invest in fisted and unlisted\nfixed interest rate debt securities, and derivatives designated upon initial. recognition at fair value through profit or Joss.\n\nThe fair values of financial instruments traded in active markets are based on quoted bid prices on the balance sheet date. A\nmarket is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry\n\u2018group, pricing service, or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions\non an arm's length basis.\n\nThe fair values of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market; are established by the directors using valuation\ntechniques which seek to arrive at the price at which an orderly transaction would take place between market participants.\n\nNet gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are presented\nin the Income Statement within \u2018Unrealised gains on investments' or \u2018Unrealised losses on investments' in the period in\nwhich they arise.\n\n35\n", "Aspen insurance UK Limited - Report and Accounts\nRegistered Number: 1184193\n\nLoans and receivables\n\nLoans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active\nmarket other than those that the Company intends to sell in the short term or that it has designated as at fair value through\nprofit or loss. When a financial asset is recognised initially it is measured at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly\nattributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset. Loans and receivables are subsequently measured at amortised\ncost using the effective interest method. Receivables arising from insurance contracts are also classified in this category and\nare reviewed for impairment as part of the impairment review of loans and receivables. This basis of valuation is viewed by\nthe directors as having prudent regard to the likely realisable value.\n\ndmpairment of financial assets\n\nFor financial assets not carried at fair value through profit or loss, the Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether\nthere is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. A financial asset or group of financial\nassets is impaired and \u2018impairment losses are incurred only if there is objective evidence of i impairment as a result of one or\nmore events that have occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a \u2018loss event') and that loss event (or events) has an\nimpact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.\nObjective evidence that a financial asset or group of assets is impaired includes observable data that comes to the attention\nof the Company about the following events:\n\n* _ significant financial difficulty of the issuer or debtor; _\n*  abreach of contract, such as a default or delinquency i in payments;\n\u00ab the lender, for economic or legal reasons relating to the borrower's financial difficulty, granting to the borrower a\nconcession that the lender would not otherwise consider;\n\u00b0 it becoming probable that the issuer or debtor will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation;\n* the disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial difficulties; or\n* \u2014 observable data indicating that there i isa measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flow from a group of\nfinancial assets since the initial recognition of those assets, although the decrease cannot yet be identified with the\nindividual financial assets in the group, including:\n* adverse changes in the payment status of issuers or debtors in the group; or\n* national or local. economic conditions that correlate with defaults on the assets in the group:\n\nIf there is objective evidence that an. impairment loss has been incurred on loans and receivables or held-to-maturity\ninvestments carried at amortised cost, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying\namountand the present value of estimated future cash fiows \u2018(excluding future credit losses thathave been: incurred) discounted\nat the financial asset's original effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced and the amount of the loss\nis recognised in the profit and loss account for the period. If'a held-to-maturity investment or a loan has a variable interest\nrate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment ioss is the current effective interest rate determined under contract. As\na practical expedient, the Company may measure impairment on the basis of an instrument's fair value using an observable\nmarket price.\n\n. Financial liabilities\nOther financial liabilities relate to derivatives which are designated at fair value through profit and loss, and classified in\naccruals and deferred income. Creditors are also financial liabilities and are recognised initially at fair value, net of directly\n\nattributable transaction costs. Greditors are subsequently stated at amortised cost; using the effective interest rate method:\nFor short term creditors (due within one year), no discounting is applied.\n\nFinancial liabilities are derecognised only when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires.\n\nInvestment return\n\nInvestment return comprises all investment income (which includes the interest income for financial assets carried at amortised\ncost, using the effective interest method), realised investment gains and losses and movements in unrealised gains and losses,\nnet of investment expenses; charges and interest payable on financial liabilities carried at amortised cost; using the effective\ninterest method.\n\nDividends are recognised when the investments to which they relate are declared \u2018ex-dividend' and include the imputed tax.\nInterest-income is recognised on a time proportionate basis taking into account effective interest method. Interest income\ncand payable and dividend income are recognised in the income statement.\n\nRealised gains and losses on investments carried at fair value through profit and loss are calculated as the difference between\nnet sales proceeds and purchase price. In the case of investments included at amortised cost, realised gains and losses are\ncalculated as the difference between sale proceeds and their latest carrying value. Movements in unrealised gains and losses\n\n36\n", "Aspen Insurance UK Limited - Report and Accounts\nRegistered Number: 1184193\n\non investments represent the difference between the fair value at the balance sheet date and their purchase price or their fair\nvalue at the last balance sheet date, together with the reversal of unrealised gains and losses recognised in earlier accounting\nperiods in respect of investment disposals in the current period.\n\nAnallocation of actual investment retum on investments supporting the genera} insurance technical provisions and associated:\nequity is made from the non-technical account to the technical account.\n\nOffsetting of financial instruments\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the statement of financial position if, and\nonly if:\n\n\u00a2 There is.a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts; and\n\n* There is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.\n\n4:3 Foreign currency\n\nItems included in the financial statements are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which\nthe operating branch operates:\n\n* The US Boilar is the functional currency and presentational currency of the Company; and\n+ The Company also operates through a number of discrete overseas branches in Switzerland , Australia,\nSingapore and Canada that have separate functional currencies.\n\n\u201cTransactions in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency of the operating segment at the foreign exchange\nrate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities (which include unearned premiums and deferred\nacquisition costs) denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated to the functional currency of\nthe operating segment at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured\nin terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.

Risk and Capital Management\n\nThe Company i is exposed to a range of financial risks through i its financial assets, financial liabilities, reinsurance assets\nand policyholder liabilities. in particular, the key financial risk is that the proceeds from financial assets are not sufficient\nto fund the obligations arising from insurance policies as they fall due. The most important components of this. financial\nrisk are insurance risk, market risk (including interest rate risk and currency risk) credit risk, and liquidity risk.\n\nThe key-risks for the Company are.as set out in the Principal Risks and Uncertainties section within the Strategic Report.\n\n(a) Risk Governance and Risk Management Strategy\n\nThe Board of Directors of the Company (\u201cthe Board\u201d) considers effective identification, measurement, monitoring,\nmanagement and reporting of the risks facing our business to be key elements of its responsibilities. The Board ensures that\nthe Company operates an effective risk management and control framework which includes risk management, compliance\nand internal control systems: The Board uses a Risk sub-committee to support the oversight of the Company'srisk management\nprocesses.\n\nThe Company, as an operating entity within the Aspen Group, benefits from the Group's established risk management\npractices. The Group' s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group and the\nCompany, to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor risks and:adherence to limits. Risk management policies\nand systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Company's activities. Further details on\nthe Group wide risk management strategy can be found in the consolidated financial statements of AIHL which are available\nto the public.\n\n(6) Capital Management Objective, Policies and Approach\n\nThe Company's capital management approach and policy is set out within its risk appetite statement which is summarised:\nin the Risk Appetite section within the Strategic Report\n\n(Insurance Risk\n\nInsurance risk is defined as the risk that underwriting results vary from their expected amounts, including the risk that reserves\nestablished in respect of prior periods are understated. Insurance risk includes the following:\n\n(a) Underwriting risk: The variation of accident year technical result from its expected value. Underwriting risk can\nbe further split into sub-categories including:\n\u00a2 Catastrophe accumulation risk: The risk that losses from natural catastrophes exceed expected levels;\n. Pricing calibration risk: The risk that actual technical results differ from expected values as a result of\ninvalid assumptions, methodology or parameters used in the pricing process;\n+ Large claims risk: The risk that losses from a single man-made event, or group of related events, exceed\nthe expected levels;\n+  Attritional risk: The risk that the total of all losses other than catastrophe and large losses exceeds the\nexpected level; and\n* Reinsurance mitigation risk: The risk that gross losses are not reduced by reinsurance recoveries to the\nextent expected.\n(b) Reserving risk: The variation in policyholder reserves for prior accident years.\n\nProcesses for addressing and monitoring risk\n\nAIUK model their exposure to underwriting and.reserving risks using the Internal Model to measure the associated capital\nrequirements on both the Solvency II SCR regulatory basis and an intemal basis. The internal basis uses a US GAAP\nbalance sheet and measures the capital required to write one year's business to ultimate. Modelling of insurance risk\nexposure is the key process for monitoring and managing insurance risk.\n\nThe Reserving policy and Aspen Group Underwriting Risk Policy evidence how Aspen manages the risk of loss or of\nadverse change in the values of insurance and reinsurance liabilities, resulting from inadequate pricing and provisioning\nassumptions.\n\n\u2018The Underwriting Risk Policy requires and defines the use of Aspen Underwriting Principles (AUPs*) or Underwriting\nGuidelines for each underwriting team, and similarly the Group Pricing Standard establishes the requirements that must\n\nbe addressed by the Pricing Policy Document (\u201cPPD\u201d) for each portfolio. AUPs or Underwriting guidelines set out a series\nof key principles translated into specific guidelines, requirements, processes and management controls, the compliance\n\n39\n", "Aspen Insurance UK Limited - Report and Accounts\nRegistered Number: 1184193\n\nof which is mandatory for all Underwriters. The PPDs set out a series of standards and principles to apply to all business\nunderwritten.\n\nThe Group Claims risk policy sets out the core risk Management requirements for the Claims process. The UK Piatform\nClaims Procedures apply to claims handling in respect of ATUK claims. It covers the full claims cycle and is supported:\nby a range of detailed procedures. It includes specific considerations in respect of the handling of ATUK claims.\n\nThe Reinsurance Mitigation Policy defines Aspen's approach to managing the risk that gross losses are not reduced by\nreinsurance recoveries to the extent expected. The Insurance Accumulation Risk policy defines Aspen's approach to\nmanagement of material risk concentrations by categorising those risks, setting tolerances and limit, measuring, monitoring,\nreporting and escalating Natural Catastrophe and Non Natural catastrophe accumulations.\n\nThe Key Risk limits are monitored and reported in the UK Certified Risk Officer's report to the AIUK Risk Committee.\n\nMaterial Risk Concentrations\n\nAIUK has limited its exposure to material risk concentrations by imposing maximum claim amounts on certain contracts as\nwell as the use of reinsurance arrangements in order to limit exposures so they are managed within key risk limits. The\nmaterial risk concentrations managed via Key Risk limits include natural catastrophe risks (such as hurricanes, earthquakes\nand flood: damage) and man-made catastrophic events (such as acts of war, acts of terrorism and losses resulting from political\ninstability). The effectiveness of these risk mitigation techniques is assessed through continual monitoring of the underlying\nrisk profile and escalation of deviations from plan.\n\nSensitivity of insurance risk\n\nThe liabilities established could be significantly lower or higher than the uitimate cost of settling the claims arising. This\nlevel of uncertainty varies between the classes of business and the nature of the risk being written and can arise from\ndevelopments i in case reserving for large losses and catastrophes, or from changes in estimates of claims incurred but not\nreported. A 5% increase or decrease in total claims liabilities would have the following effect on profit or loss:\n\nYear ended 31 December 2019 2018\n{$ in millions) 5% Increase 5% Decrease \u20185% Increase 5% Decrease\nTotal (60.8) 60.8 (74.9) 749\n\nClaims development table\n\nReserves are required owing to the time between the occurrences, reporting and eventual settlement of a loss, which, for\nsome lines of business, can be several years. Since reserves are an estimate of the likely outcome of these future events,\nthey are subject to a degree of volatility. \"That is, the actual emergence of ultimate losses can be expected to differ, perhaps\nmaterially, from any estimate of such losses. The users should be aware that loss payment and loss reporting patterns are\nnot the only considerations in establishing loss reserves.\n\nin setting claims provisions the Company gives consideration to the probability and magnitude of future experience being\nmore adverse than assumed and-exercises a degree of caution in setting reserves where there is considerable uncertainty. In\ngeneral, the uncertainty associated with the ultimate claims experience in an accident year is greatest when the accident year\nis at an early stage of development and the margin necessary to provide the necessary confidence in the provisions adequacy\nis relatively at its highest. As claims develop, and the ultimate cost of claims becomes more certain, the relative level of\nmargin maintained should decrease. The following | tables show an analysis of incurred claims and allocated loss adjustment\nexpenses and net of reinsurance as at 31 December 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2013 and 2011. The toss\ndevelopment triangles are derived from ail business written by the Company, as although a limited number of contracts are\nwritten which have durations of greater than one year the contracts do not meet the definition of a long duration contract.\nThe Company has taken advantage of the transitional rules of FRS 103 that permit only five years of information to be\ndisclosed upon adoption. The claims development information disclosed is being increased from five years to ten years over\nthe period 2015-2020.

We classify reinvestment risk as the risk of lower yields on the reinvestment of the proceeds\nfrom coupons payments, maturities and prepayments, which is a sub-category of interest rate risk.\n\n4l\n", "Aspen Insurance UK Limited - Report and Accounts\nRegistered Number: 1184193\n\nSpread risk (including default risk): The yield of a non-government fixed income security can be divided into two\nparts:\n\n(6) The \u2018risk free' rate, being the yield of the treasury security issued by the country in which the issuer operates\nwhich is closest to it in maturity; and\n{ii} The \u2018spread' of the yield over the risk free rate (= total yield - risk free rate).\n\nThe spread is normally positive because it represents the extra consideration required by the market to compensate for the\ngreater risk (compared to the Government issuer) of default on interest or redemption. The spread may also be influenced\nby the actual or perceived liquidity or marketability of the security.\n\nThe spread of a bond also adjusts over time to reflect the spread required on similar new issues. This movement up or down\nin spread therefore also contributes to overall market risk and ATUK calls this \u2018spread risk'. ATUK also includes within spread\nrisk the risk that a security falls in value as a result of being downgraded by a rating agency as this will also cause the spread\nto increase. The risk of actual default on interest or redemption as a special case of spread risk is aiso included. This defauit\nrisk is actually a type of credit risk but it is appropriate to deal with it here under market risk because of the way it is modelled\nin the Intemmal Model as an extreme case of downgrade risk.\n\nSpread risk is managed by limiting the overall credit quality of the investment portfolio and the concentrations of investments\n\nwith specific issuers of investments. This risk is mitigated by limiting exposure to any single counterparty.\n\n- 3) Equity risk: AIUK defines Equity risk as the risk of adverse movements in the market price of investments\n(or their derivatives) other than fixed income securities. Unlike Fixed Income Securities the value of equities is\nnot directly linked to interest rates and spreads, there are many factors that affect the value of investments. The\nCompany does not invest in equities so this risk is not currently relevant to the Company.\n\n4) Market risk mitigation risk: The risk of variation in the value or effectiveness of hedging positions.\n\n5) Asset concentration risk: The aggregate value of AIUK's investment portfolio may be at greater risk if it is\noverexposed to the same asset or a group of similar assets with similar risk dynamics. Concentrations which\nAIUK seek to manage include types of asset (e.g. mortgage backed securities), economic sector of issuer and\nsecurities of the same issuer.\n\n6) Valuation Risk: Some assets within AIUK's investment portfolio can be \u201cprivate assets\u201d for which there are no\nreadily available market prices. There is a risk that the approaches used to value these \u201cprivate assets\u201d result in\nincorrect correct Values. As at 31 December 2019 ATUK did not have any investments in \u201cprivate assets\u201d\n\nConcentrations which AIUK seek to manage for this reason include types of asset (e.g. mortgage backed securities),\neconomic sector of issuer and securities of the same issuer.\n\nProcesses for addressing and monitoring risk\n\nAs with Insurance risk, Aspen model exposure to market risk using the Internal Model to measure the associated capital\nrequirements on both an internal basis and the Solvency II SCR regulatory basis. Modelting market risk exposures is a key\nprocess for monitoring and managing market risk.\n\nThe Investment Risk Policy and Guidelines describes the investment strategy in the context of the annual business plan,\nasset allocation, and concentration limits at group and AIUK levels.\n\nThe Investment Risk Policy and Guidelines describes the measurement of market risks, and specifically describes what is\npermissible with regards to the use of derivatives in order to manage currency positions, portfolio duration and interest rate\nrisk in the investment portfolio.\n\nUse of derivatives is limited to interest rate swaps, forward rate transactions, bond options, interest rate futures, foreign\nexchange spot and forward transactions and currency options. During 2019, ATUK only entered into foreign exchange forward\ntransactions and has no off balance sheet exposures.\n\nThe Asset and Liability Management Policy defines Aspen's approach to duration and currency matching. Management\nmonitors the value, currency and duration of cash and investments held by AIUK to ensure that it is able to meet the insurance\nand other liabilities as they become due. The following components of both cash matching and duration matching are employed\nto manage the investment portfolio:\n\n* the average duration of liabilities;\n\n42\n", "Aspen Insurance UK Limited - Report and Accounts\nRegistered Number: 1184193\n\n\u00a2 the outlook for interest rates and the yield curve;\n\u00ab the need for cash to pay claims; and\n* total return.\n\nMaterial Risk Concentrations\n\nAs with Insurance Risks as well as modelling exposures and the capital required to address potential market risks using the\nInternal Model ATUK has also limited its exposure to material risk concentrations through the use of Key Risk Limits. These\nmaterial risk concentrations include foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and equity risk.\n\nKey Risk limits regarding asset allocation, overall credit rating and the volatility of ATUK's investment portfolio have been\ndefined by management and approved by the Board. in order that AIUK can manage its currency risks within the regulatory\nparameters required, a Key Risk Limit approved by the Board limits the mismatch between assets and liabilities where there\nare material positions in currencies other than the functional currency of AIUK. The effectiveness of risk mitigation techniques\nis.assessed through continual monitoring of the underlying risk profile and escalation of any deviations from plan.\n\nSensitivity analysis\n\nForeign currency risk\n\nAs at 31 December 2019; if the U.S. Dollar had weakened / strengthened by 10% with all other variables held constant the\nloss for the year would have been $1.8m (2018: $6.8m) higher / lower, mainly as a result of foreign exchange gains / tosses\non the translation of non U.S. Dollar denominated financial assets, and foreign exchange losses / gains on translation of non\nU.S. Dollar denominated insurance liabilities.\n\nInterest rate risk\nThe table below depicts interest rate change scenarios and the effect on Profit 0 it or loss from AIUK?'s interest rate sensitive\ninvested assets:\n\ni basis paiats -160 \u201c50 +50 +100\n31 December 2019 .\nFixed income portfolio effect - gain/(loss) ($m) 73.3 36.7 (36.7) (73.3)\n31 December 2018\nFixed income portfolio effect - gain/(loss) ($m) 75.3 37.6 (37.6) (75.3)\n\nGiven the outbreak of the coronavirus, which has materially affected the valuation of investments since year-end,\nwe have chosen to additionally show the sensitivity on 31 March 2020 values.\n\n31 March 2020\nFixed income portfolio effect - gain/(loss) ($m) BB 36.9 (36.9) {73.8)\n\nSpread risk\n\nAs past of spread risk ATUK include the risk that a security falls in value as a result of being downgraded by a rating agency\nas this will also cause the spread to increase.

AUK is exposed to credit risk through its investment holdings. As already stated within the\nInternal Model and management process, AIUK treats credit risk relating to investments (including cash and debt securities)\nas part of Market risk.\n\nCounterparty default risk\n\nAIUK is also exposed to credit risk through the diminution in the value of insurance receivables as a result of counterparty\ndefault. This principally comprises default and concentration risks relating to amounts receivable from intermediaries,\npolicyholders and reinsurers. Reinsurance and retrocession does not isolate ATUK from its obligations to policyholders. In\nthe event that a reinsurer or retrocessionaire fails to meet its obligation, ATUK's obligations remain.\n\nProcesses for addressing and monitoring risk\n\nAs with Insurance risk, AIUK model exposure to credit risks using the Internal Model to measure the associated: capital:\nrequirements on both an internal basis and the Solvency II SCR regulatory basis. Modelling of credit risk exposures is the\n\u2018key process for monitoring and managing credit risk.\n\nThe processes for addressing credit risk in relation to financial instruments has already been dealt with as part of the explanation\nofthe processes to address market risk. The Group Insurance Credit Risk policy defines the processes for assessing, monitoring\nand managing credit exposure to intermediaries, policyholders and reinsurance counterparties.\n\nMaterial Risk Concentrations\n\nAIUK limits its exposure to material risk concentrations through the use of Key Risk Limits. ATUK is potentially exposed\nto concentrations of credit risk in respect of amounts recoverable from reinsurers, and insurance and reinsurance balances\nowed by the brokers with whom it transacts business. AIUK manages the ieveis of credit risk by placing limits on its exposure\ntoa single counterparty, or groups of counterparty. Such risks are subject to regular review. The creditworthiness of reinsurers\nis considered on an annual basis by reviewing their financial strength prior to finalisation of any contract. In addition,\n\nmanagement assesses the creditworthiness of all reinsurers and intermediaries by reviewing credit grades provided by rating\nagencies and other publicly available financial information. The recent payment history of reinsurers is also used to update\nthe reinsurance purchasing strategy. AIUK has risk limits for the amount of exposure to both third party and intragroup\nrelated reinsurers and any breaches of those limits are reported to the AIUK Risk Committee and Board. The effectiveness\nof these risk mitigation techniques is assessed through continual monitoring of the underlying risk profile.\n\nFor the Year Eaded 31 December\n\n2019 2018\nSin millions)\nReinsuirers' share of claims outstanding 2,565.4 2,366.7\nDebtors arising out of direct insurance operations - intermediaries 47.2 93.5\nDebtors arising out of reinsurance operations 749.1 675.0\n\u2018Cash at'bank anid if hand 103.2 142.1\nDeposits with ceding undertakings 32.4 348\nLoans and receivables 16.2 313\nDebt securities and other fixed income securities : 2,138.7 2,214.5\nShort term investments 297.1 216.8\nDerivative financial assets 6.9 6.2\nTotal assets bearing credit risk \u00a7,956.2 5,780.9\nAAA 279.9 . 339.7\nAA 1,378.5 1,319.0\nA 546.4 567.0\nBBB 60.8 72.3\nBelow BBB \u2014_ 0.5\nOther 3,690.6 3,482.4\nTotal assets. bearing credit risk \u00a7,956.2 5,780.9\n\nCollateral\n", "Aspen Insurance UK Limited - Report and Accounts\nRegistered Number: 1184193\n\nThe amount and type of collateral required depends on an assessment of the credit risk of the counterparty. Guidelines are\nimplemented regarding the acceptability of types of collateral and the valuation parameters. Credit risk is also mitigated by\nentering into collateral agreements. Management monitors the market value of the collateral, requests additional collateral\nwhen needed and performs an impairment valuation when applicable. At 31 December 2019, the fair value of such collateral\nheld was $450.0m (2018: $412.0m). No collateral received from the counterparty has been sold or repledged (2018: Nil).\n\n@ Liquidity risk\nLiquidity risk is defined as the risk of failing to maintain sufficient liquid financial resources to meet liabilities as they fall\ndue or to provide collateral as required for commercial or regulatory purposes.\n\nLiquidity risk includes the following:\n\ni) Payment default risk: The risk that there is insufficient cash to make payments when due and that no additional\nGash can be made available by borrowing, sal\u00e9 of assets or Capital raisiiig.\n\nii) Risk of unplanned asset realisation losses: The risk that securities are required to be sold at a loss to meet liquidity\nrequirements.\n\niii) Risk of failure of credit facility: The risk that advances from the credit facility are unavailable:\niv) Group liquidity risk: The risk that liquidity cannot be secured. for a Group. company from elsewhere in the Group.\n\ny) Collateral risk: The risk that ATUK is unable to provide collateral to a third party when contractually required to do\n\nProcesses for addressing and monitoring risk\n\nUnlike Insurance, Market and Credit Risk ATUK does not mode/ and manage liquidity risk using its internal Model as it is\nnot a risk that is mitigated by holding capital against it. ATUK's annual Stress & Scenario Testing (\u201cSST\u201d) process is used.\nto determine the basis of the Key Liquidity risk limit. The Liquidity Risk Policy provides further details of how liquidity\nrisks are identified, monitored, managed and modelled. This inctudes details of an escalation process for a breach of the\nminimum free funds limit.\n\nMaterial Risk Concentrations\n\nAIUK limits its exposure to material risk concentrations through the operation of the Liquidity Risk Policy. This highlights\nthe measures that Aspen have put in place in order to maintain an agreed amount of unencumbered assets in cash and cash\nequivalents. These measures include concentration limits to ensure the liquidity of assets, appropriateness of the marketability\nor realisability of assets and a liquidity contingency funding plan.\n\nLiquidity stress testing is carried out against ATUK's and the Group's risk profiles at least annually by the Risk Management\ndepartment as part of the Stress and Scenario Testing programme. This allows management to identify the potential strains\non ATUK's liquidity as a result of the scenarios assessed as well as gaining understanding of the Group's ability to support\nthe liquidity needs of entities such as AIUK as the need arises. Cash-flow forecasting is also used to reduce liquidity risk.\nThe effectiveness of these risk mitigation techniques is assessed through continual monitoring of the underlying risk profile.\nThe table below analyses the Company's liabilities into their relevant maturity groups based on the period remaining at\nthe year end to their contractual maturities or expected settlement dates:\n\n45\n", "Aspen Insurance UK Limited - Report and Accounts\nRegistered Number: 1184193\n\n3i Daceinber 2019 Uptolyeir  1-3yeats\n(Sin millions)\nClaims outstanding 933.7 1,047.7 $72.3 1,280.8 3,834.5\nProvision for unearned premiums 486.0 157.0 60.6 544 758.0\nAmounts due to group undertakings 749.0 _ _ _ 749.0\nOther creditors 264.6 _\u2014 _\u2014 \u2014 264.6\nAccruals and deferred income 54.2 = \u2014 _ 542\n\u201cTotal 2,487.5 1,204.7 632.9 1,335.2 5,660.3\n31 December 2018 Up to 1 year 1-3 years 3S years Over 5 years Total\n(S iii ims)\nClaims outstanding 956.7 1,230.4 589.0 1,011.1 3,787.2\nProvision for unearned premiums 545.4 158.7 48.4 41.3 793.8\nAmounts due to group undertakings 603.4 _ \u2014_ _ 603.4\nOther creditors 218.7 _\u2014 = - 218.7\nAccruals and deferred income 3.0 _ _\u2014 \u2014 3.0\nTotal 2327.2 1,389.1 637.4 1,052.4 \u00a7,406.1\n\n46\n", "3.

Subsequent Events\n\nIn February 2020, the company ceased underwriting Marine & Energy Liability business. This was due to significant\ndeterioration on prior years and loss activity' in the current year in a market where pricing is not correcting sufficiently enough.\n\n- This marketplace has not generated sustainable profit margins, and we are shifting our focus to areas where we believe there\nis better opportunity to achieve our long-term profitability targets.\n\nIn addition, the company exited the Accident & Health line in March 2020 due to adverse claims development versus plan\nand uncertain sustainable profitability of this type of business with high acquisition and operating costs.\n\nOn March 2, 2020, the Aspen Group, with AIUK as a named party entered into an adverse development reinsurance agreement\nwith Cavello Bay Reinsurance Limited (\"Cavello\"), a Bermuda insurance company and wholly owned subsidiary of Enstar\nGroup Limited.

Like many property and casualty (re)insurers, we have possible exposure to the\ncontingency market and cancellation losses stemming from the COVID-19 outbreak and could also face: COVID-19 related\nclaims from creditand surety tines and potential exposure from business i interruption. Whether the virus could trigger coverage\nis dependent on specific policy language, terms and exclusions. There is a risk, however, that legislative, regulatory, judicial\nor social influences may extend coverage beyond our intended contractual obligations or result in an increase in the frequency\nor severity of claims beyond expected levels. The volatility in the financial markets resulting from the outbreak may also\n\u2018impact our investment portfolio. Our investment portfolio comprises primarily government and other fixed income securities\nand we are not significantly exposed to equity markets. However, our corporate bond portfolio could be subject to valuation\nrisk as a result of movements in corporate spreads and default risk in the event of extended disruption to trade. In addition,\n\nexisting and potential future travel bans, preventative or government mandated closures of our offices or the offices of our\noutsource providers may affect our ability to conduct our business. A prolonged period of commercial disruption, reduced\neconomic activity and other consequences of the outbreak could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial\ncondition or liquidity. It is not practicable to quantify the ultimate financial effect of the outbreak on the Company at this\nstage.\n\nThe Board has undertaken an assessment to determine the impact of COVID-i9 on the company and its future viability.\nThis assessment has included a review of potential insurance and investment exposures under moderate and severe scenarios\nand regular monitoring of current and projected solvency levels. The scenarios encompass different assumed durations of\nthe effects of the outbreak, credit spreads widening by upto 400-600 basis points, yields on the investment portfolio dropping\nto nil for these different durations and an estimate of (reinsurance losses by reviewing various business lines where exposures\nare likely (direct and indirectly) and quantifying the estimated loss exposures. This analysis was supplemented by a reverse\n\n57\n", "Aspen Insurance UK. Limited - Report and Accounts\n\nstress test to determine the level of, and likelihood of, capital erosion that would result in an adverse impact on the Company's\nability to satisfy regulatory capital thresholds.\n\nAdditional sensitivities have been provided on page 43 to capture the impact of widening credit spreads and interest rate\nmovements on our fixed income portfolio at 31 March 2020 to support our ongoing assessment. ,\n\nBased on our analysis and our latest estimate of the solvency position the Company's capital resources remain comfortably\nin excess of the relevant regulatory capital thresholds and projected to do so under severe scenarios; the reverse stress test\nindicates that the level at which an adverse impact would arise on the Company's ability to satisfy regulatory capital thresholds\nis: sufficiently remote. Accordingly the Directors have concluded that although the impact from COVID-15 is likely to be\nmaterial it does not adversely affect the company's ability to continue as a going concern or reduce its capital and solvency\nlevels to below regulatory requirements. Our priority remains to support our staff and honour our client's needs.\n\nGn March 26, 2020, S&P downgraded the financiai strength and issuer credit ratings of the Company to\u201cA ~ (Strong) from\n\u201cA\u201d (Strong). The outlook assigned to this rating is stable. On April 1, 2020, A.M. Best affirmed the financial strength rating\n\nof \u201cA\u201d (Excellent) for ATUK but revised its outlook to negative from stable. The Company does not believe that these rating\nactions will in any way compromise our ability to service the needs of our customers and trading partners or our obligations\nto them. However, the downgrade may impair our ability to sell insurance policies and could materially and adversely affect\nour competitive position in the insurance industry, future financial condition and operating results.\n\n58\n"], "source_type": "Image", "total_page": 58}]
